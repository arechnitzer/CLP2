<statement><p>
For which values of <m>b</m> is the integral
<m>\displaystyle\int_0^b \frac{1}{x^2-1} \dee{x}</m> improper?
</p></statement>
<hint><p>
There are two kinds of impropreity in an integral: an infinite discontinuity in the integrand, and an infinite limit of integration.
</p></hint>
<answer><p>
Any real number in <m>[1,\infty)</m> or <m>(-\infty,-1]</m>, and <m>b = \pm \infty</m>.
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
If <m> b = \pm \infty</m>, then our integral is improper because one limit is not a real number.
</p>

<p>Furthermore, our integral will be improper if its domain of integration contains either of its infinite discontinuities, <m>x=1</m> and <m>x=-1</m>. Since one limit of integration is 0, the integral is improper if <m>b \geq 1</m> or if <m>b \leq -1</m>.
</p>

<p>Below, we've graphed <m>\frac{1}{x^2-1}</m> to make it clearer why values of <m>b</m> in <m>(-1,1)</m> are the only values that <em>don't</em> result in an improper integral when the other limit of integration is <m>a=0</m>.

<hint><p>
What matters is which function is bigger for large values of <m>x</m>, not  near the origin.
</p></hint>

The red function is <m>f(x)</m>, and the blue function is <m>g(x)</m>.

<solution><p>
For large values of <m>x</m>, <m>|\text{red function}|\leq \text{(blue function)}</m> and <m>0 \leq \text{(blue function)}</m>. If the blue function's integral converged, then the red function's integral would as well (by the comparison test, Theorem<nbsp/><xref ref="thm_IMPcomparison"/> in the text).

Decide whether the following statement is true or false.
If false, provide a counterexample. If true, provide a brief justification.
(Assume that <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> are continuous functions.)
</p>

<p>
If <m>\displaystyle\int_{1}^{\infty} f(x) \,\dee{x}</m> converges and <m>g(x)\ge f(x)\ge 0</m> for all <m>x</m>, then <m>\displaystyle\int_{1}^{\infty} g(x) \,\dee{x}</m> converges.
</p></statement>

<hint><p>
Read both the question and Theorem <xref ref="thm_IMPcomparison"/> <em>very</em> carefully.
</p></hint>

<answer><p>
False. For example, the functions <m>f(x)=e^{-x}</m> and <m>g(x)=1</m> provide a counterexample.
</p>

</answer>

<solution><p>
False. The inequality goes the <q>wrong way</q> for Theorem <xref ref="thm_IMPcomparison"/>: the area under the curve <m>f(x)</m> is finite, but the area under <m>g(x)</m> could be much larger, even infinitely larger.
</p>

<p> For example, if <m>f(x)=e^{-x}</m> and <m>g(x)=1</m>,
then <m>0 \leq f(x) \leq g(x)</m> and <m>\displaystyle\int_{1}^{\infty} f(x) \,\dee{x}</m> converges, but
<m>\displaystyle\int_{1}^{\infty} g(x) \,\dee{x}</m> diverges.

<p>For each of the functions <m>h(x)</m> described below, decide whether <m>\int_{0\vphantom{\frac12}}^\infty h(x) \dee{x}</m> converges or diverges, or whether there isn't enough information to decide. Justify your decision.

<ol label="a">
<li>
<p>
Not enough information to decide. For example, consider <m>h(x) = 0</m> versus <m>h(x) = -1</m>. In both cases, <m>h(x) \leq f(x)</m>. However, <m>\displaystyle\int_0^\infty 0 \dee{x}</m> converges to 0, while <m>\displaystyle\int_0^\infty -1 \dee{x}</m> diverges.
</p>

<p>Note: if we had also specified <m>0 \leq h(x)</m>, then we would be able to conclude that <m> \int_0^\infty h(x) \dee{x}</m> converges by the comparison test.

<p>
<m>\displaystyle\int_{0\vphantom{\frac12}}^{\infty}h(x) \dee{x}</m> converges.
<ul>
<li> From the given information, <m>|h(x)| \leq 2f(x)</m>.

<li><p>
We claim <m>\displaystyle\int_{0\vphantom{\frac12}}^{\infty} 2f(x) \dee{x} </m> converges.

<li> We can see this by writing <m>\displaystyle\int_{0\vphantom{\frac12}}^{\infty} 2f(x) \dee{x}= 2\int_0^{\infty} f(x) \dee{x} </m>  and noting that the second integral converges.
</li>
<li> Alternately, we can use  the limiting comparison test, Theorem<nbsp/><xref ref="thm_IMPcomparisonLim"/>. Since <m>f(x) \geq 0</m>,  <m>\displaystyle\int_0^\infty f(x) \dee{x}</m> converges, and <m>\lim\limits_{x \to \infty}\dfrac{2f(x)}{f(x)}=2</m> (the limit exists), we conclude <m>\displaystyle\int_0^\infty 2f(x) \dee{x}</m> converges.

<li> So, comparing <m>h(x)</m> to <m>2f(x)</m>, by the comparison test (Theorem<nbsp/><xref ref="thm_IMPcomparison"/>)
<m>\displaystyle\int_0^{\vphantom{\frac12}\infty}h(x) \dee{x}</m> converges.

<statement><p>
Evaluate the integral
<m>\displaystyle\int_0^1\frac{x^4}{x^5-1}\,\dee{x}</m> or state that
it diverges.
</p></statement>

<hint><p>
First: is the integrand unbounded, and if so, where?
</p>

<p>Second: when evaluating integrals, always check to see if you can use a simple
substitution before trying a complicated procedure like partial fractions.
</p></hint>

<answer><p>
The integral diverges.
</p></answer>

<solution><p>
The denominator is zero when <m>x=1</m>, but the numerator is not, so the integrand has a
singularity (infinite discontinuity) at <m>x=1</m>. Let's replace the limit <m>x=1</m> with a variable that creeps toward 1.
<me>
\int_0^1\frac{x^4}{x^5-1}\,\dee{x}
=\lim_{t\rightarrow 1^-}\int_0^t\frac{x^4}{x^5-1}\,\dee{x}
</me>
To evaluate this integral we use the substitution
<m>u=x^5</m>, <m>\dee{u}=5x^4\dee{x}</m>. When <m>x=0</m> we have <m>u=0</m>, and when <m>x=t</m>
we have <m>u=t^5</m>, so
<md>
<mrow>
\int_0^1\frac{x^4}{x^5-1}\,\dee{x}&amp;=\lim_{t \to 1^-}\int_{0}^{t}\frac{x^4}{x^5-1}\,\dee{x}
=\lim_{t \to 1^-}\int_{u=0}^{u=t^5}\frac{1}{5(u-1)}\,\dee{u}
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=\lim_{t \to 1^-}\left( \left[\frac{1}{5}\log|u-1|\right]_0^{t^5}\right)
=\lim_{t \to 1^-}\frac{1}{5}\log|t^5-1|=-\infty
</mrow>
</md>
The limit diverges, so the integral diverges as well.

<statement><p>
Determine whether the integral
<m>\displaystyle\int_{-2}^2\frac{1}{(x+1)^{4/3}}\,\dee{x}</m> is convergent
or divergent. If it is convergent, find its value.
</p></statement>

<hint><p>
Is the integrand bounded?
</p></hint>

<answer><p>
The integral diverges.
</p></answer>

<solution><p>
The denominator of the integrand is zero when <m>x=-1</m>, but the numerator is not. So, the integrand has a singularity (infinite discontinuity) at <m>x=-1</m>. This is the only <q>source of impropriety</q> in this integral, so we only need to make one break in the domain of integration.
<me>
\int_{-2}^2\frac{1}{(x+1)^{4/3}}\,\dee{x}
=\lim_{t\rightarrow -1^-}\int_{-2}^t \frac{1}{(x+1)^{4/3}}\,\dee{x}
  +\lim_{t\rightarrow -1^+}\int_t^2 \frac{1}{(x+1)^{4/3}}\,\dee{x}
</me>
Let's start by considering the left limit.
<md>
<mrow>
\lim_{t \to -1^-}\int_{-2}^t \frac{1}{(x+1)^{4/3}}\,\dee{x}
&amp;=\lim_{t \to -1^-}\left(\left[-\frac{3}{(x+1)^{1/3}}\right|_{-2}^t\right)
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=\lim_{t \to -1^-}\left(-\frac{3}{(t+1)^{1/3}}+\frac{3}{(-1)^{1/3}}\right)=\infty
</mrow>
</md>
Since this limit diverges, the integral diverges. (A similar argument shows
that the second integral diverges. Either one of them diverging is enough to conclude that the
original integral diverges.)

<statement><p>
 Does the improper integral
<m>\displaystyle\int_1^\infty\frac{1}{\sqrt{4x^2-x}}\,\dee{x}</m> converge? Justify your
answer.
</p></statement>

<hint><p>
See Example <xref ref="eg_IMPp10"/>. Rather than antidifferentiating, you can find a nice comparison.
</p></hint>

<answer><p>
The integral does not converge.
</p></answer>

<solution><p>
First, let's identify all <q>sources of impropriety.</q> The integrand has a singularity when <m>4x^2-x=0</m>, that is, when <m>x(4x-1)=0</m>, so at <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=\frac{1}{4}</m>. Neither of these are in our domain of integration, so the only <q>source of impropriety</q> is the unbounded domain of integration.
</p>

<p>We could antidifferentiate this function (it looks like a nice candidate for a trig substitution), but is seems easier to use a comparison. For large values of <m>x</m>, the term <m>x^2</m> will be much larger than <m>x</m>, so we might guess that our integral behaves similarly to <m>\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{4x^2}} \dee{x}=\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{2x} \dee{x}</m>.
</p>

<p>For all <m>x\ge 1</m>, <m>\sqrt{4x^2-x}\le\sqrt{4x^2}=2x</m>. So, <m>\frac{1}{\sqrt{4x^2-x}} \geq \frac{1}{2x}</m>. Note <m>\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{2x} \dee{x}</m> diverges:
<md>
<mrow>\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}\int_1^t\frac{1}{2x}\,\dee{x}
=\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}\left(\frac{1}{2} \big[\log x\big]_1^t\right)
=\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{2} \log t
=\infty
</mrow>
</md>
So:
<ul>
<li> <m>\frac{1}{2x}</m> and <m>\frac{1}{\sqrt{4x^2-x}}</m> are defined and continuous for all <m>x \geq 1</m>,
</li>
<li> <m>\frac{1}{2x} \geq 0</m> for all <m>x \geq 1</m>,
</li>
<li> <m>\frac{1}{\sqrt{4x^2-x}} \ge\frac{1}{\sqrt{4x^2}} = \frac{1}{2x} </m> for all <m>x \ge 1</m>, and
</li>
<li> <m>\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{2x} \dee{x}</m> diverges.
</li>
</ul>
By the comparison test, Theorem<nbsp/><xref ref="thm_IMPcomparison"/> in the text, the integral does not converge.

<hint><p>
Which of the two terms in the denominator is more important when <m>x\approx
0</m>? Which one is more important when <m>x</m> is very large?
</p></hint>

<answer><p>
The integral converges.
</p></answer>

<solution><p>
The integrand is positive everywhere. So, either the integral
converges to some finite number, or it is infinite. We want to generate a guess as to which it is.
</p>

<p>When <m>x</m> is small, <m>\sqrt{x} \gt x^2</m>, so we might guess that our integral behaves like the integral of <m>\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}</m> when <m>x</m> is near to 0. On the other hand, when <m>x</m> is large, <m>\sqrt{x} \lt x^2</m>, so we might guess that our integral behaves like the integral of <m>\frac{1}{x^2}</m> as <m>x</m> goes to infinity.  This is the hunch that drives the following work:

<p>Remark: it's very tempting to think that this integral should converge, because as an odd function the area to the right of the <m>x</m>-axis <q>cancels out</q> the area to the left when the limits of integration are symmetric. One justification for not using this intuition is given in Example<nbsp/><xref ref="eg_IMPp4"/> in the text. Here's another:
In Question<nbsp/><xref ref="prob_s1_11_cosine"/> we saw that <m>\int_{-\infty}^\infty \cos x \dee{x}</m> diverges. Since <m>\sin x = \cos (x-\pi/2)</m>, the area bounded by sine and the area bounded by cosine over an infinite region seem to be the same--only shifted by <m>\pi/2</m>. So if <m>\int_{-\infty}^\infty \sin x \dee{x}=0</m>, then we ought to also have <m>\int_{-\infty}^\infty \cos x \dee{x}=0</m>, but we saw in Question<nbsp/><xref ref="prob_s1_11_cosine"/> this is not the case.

Evaluate <m>\displaystyle\int_{10}^\infty \frac{x^4-5x^3+2x-7}{x^5+3x+8}  \dee{x}</m>, or state that it diverges.

The easiest test in this case is  limiting comparison, Theorem<nbsp/><xref ref="thm_IMPcomparisonLim"/>.
</p></hint>
<answer><p>
The integral diverges.
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
First, we check that the integrand has no singularities. The denominator is always positive when <m>x \ge 10</m>, so our only <q>source of impropriety</q> is the infinite limit of integration.
</p>

<p>We further note that, for large values of <m>x</m>, the integrand resembles <m>\dfrac{x^4}{x^5} = \dfrac{1}{x\vphantom{\frac12}}</m>. So, we have a two-part hunch: that the integral diverges, and that we can show it diverges by comparing it to <m>\displaystyle\int_{10}^\infty \frac{1}{x} \dee{x}</m>.
</p>

<p>In order to use the comparison test, we'd need to show that <m>\displaystyle\frac{x^4-5x^3+2x-7}{x^5+3x+8}  \geq \frac{1}{\vphantom{\frac12}x}</m>. If this is true, it will be difficult to prove--and it's not at all clear that it's true. So, we will use the limiting comparison test instead, Theorem<nbsp/><xref ref="thm_IMPcomparisonLim"/>, with <m>g(x)= \dfrac{1}{x}</m>,
<m>f(x)=\dfrac{x^4-5x^3+2x-7}{x^5+3x+8} </m>, and <m>a=10</m>.
</p>

<p><ul>
<li> Both <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> are defined and continuous for all <m>x  \gt 0</m>, so in particular they are defined and continuous for <m>x \geq 10</m>.

You might think that, because the integrand is odd, the integral

Both halves diverge, so the whole integral diverges.
</p>

<p>Once again: after we found that one of the limits diverged, we could have stopped and concluded that the original integrand diverges. Don't make the mistake of thinking that <m>\infty-\infty=0</m>. That can get you into
<em>big</em> trouble. <m>\infty</m> is not a normal number. For
example <m>2\infty=\infty</m>. So if <m>\infty</m> were a normal number we would have
both <m>\infty-\infty=0</m> and <m>\infty-\infty=2\infty-\infty =\infty</m>.

Which of the two terms in the denominator is more important when <m>x\approx
0</m>? Which one is more important when <m>x</m> is very large?
</p></hint>

<answer><p>
The integral converges.
</p></answer>

<solution><p>
We don't want to antidifferentiate this integrand, so let's use a comparison. Note the integrand is positive when <m>x \gt 0</m>.
</p>

<p>For any <m>x</m>, <m>|\sin x| \leq 1</m>, so <m>\dfrac{|\sin x|}{x^{3/2}+x^{1/2}} \leq \dfrac{1}{x^{3/2}+x^{1/2}} </m>.
</p>

<p>Since <m>x=0</m> and <m>x \to \infty</m> both cause the integral to be improper, we need to break it into two pieces.
Since both terms in the denominator give positive numbers when <m>x</m> is positive, <m>\dfrac{1}{x^{3/2}+x^{1/2}} \leq \dfrac{1}{x^{3/2}}</m> and <m>\dfrac{1}{x^{3/2}+x^{1/2}} \leq \dfrac{1}{x^{1/2}}</m>. That gives us two options for comparison.
</p>

<p>When <m>x</m> is positive and close to zero, <m>x^{1/2}  \ge x^{3/2}</m>, so we guess that we should compare our integrand to <m>\frac{1}{x^{1/2}}</m> near the limit <m>x=0</m>. In contrast, when <m>x</m> is very large, <m>x^{1/2}  \le x^{3/2}</m>, so we guess that we should compare our integrand to <m>\frac{1}{x^{3/2}}</m> as <m>x</m> goes to infinity.

Now we have all the data we need to apply the comparison test, Theorem<nbsp/><xref ref="thm_IMPcomparison"/>.

<li> <m>\dfrac{|\sin x|}{x^{3/2}+x^{1/2}}\,, \dfrac{1}{x^{1/2}}\,,</m> and <m>\dfrac{1}{x^{3/2}}</m> are defined and continuous for <m>x \gt 0</m>

</li>
<li> <m>\dfrac{|\sin x|}{x^{3/2}+x^{1/2}}\le \dfrac{1}{x^{1/2}}</m> for all <m>x  \gt  0</m> and
<m>\displaystyle\int_0^1\dfrac{1}{x^{1/2}} \dee{x}</m> converges, so (using Remark<nbsp/><xref ref="rmk_singularities"/>)
<textblue> <m>\displaystyle\int_0^{1\vphantom{\frac12}}\dfrac{|\sin x|}{x^{3/2}+x^{1/2}} \dee{x}</m> converges. </textblue>

<li> <m>\dfrac{|\sin x|}{x^{3/2}+x^{1/2}}\le \dfrac{1}{x^{3/2}}</m> for all <m>x \ge 1</m> and

The integrand is positive everywhere, so either the integral

the fact that the domain of integration extends to <m>\infty</m>.

Let's develop a hunch about whether the integral converges or diverges. When <m>x\approx 0</m>,  <m>x^2</m> and <m>x</m> are both a lot smaller than 1, so we guess we should compare the integrand to <m>\frac{1}{x^{1/3}}</m>.
<me>
\frac{x+1}{x^{1/3}(x^2+x+1)} \approx \frac{1}{x^{1/3}(1)} =
                                      \frac{1}{x^{1/3}}
</me>
Note <m>\int_0^1 \frac{1}{x^{1/3}} \dee{x}</m> converges by Example<nbsp/><xref ref="eg_IMPp2"/> (it's a <m>p</m>-type integral), so we guess <m>\int_0^1 \frac{x+1}{x^{1/3}(x^2+x+1)} \dee{x}</m> converges as well.
</p>

<p>When <m>x</m> is very large, <m>x^2</m> is much bigger than <m>x</m>, which is much bigger than 1, so we guess we should compare the integrand to <m>\frac{1}{x^{4/3}}</m>.
<me>
\frac{x+1}{x^{1/3}(x^2+x+1)} \approx \frac{x}{x^{1/3}(x^2)} =
                                      \frac{1}{x^{4/3}}

Note <m>\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^{4/3}} \dee{x}</m> converges by Example<nbsp/><xref ref="eg_IMPp1"/> (it's a <m>p</m>-type integral), so we guess <m>\int_1^\infty \frac{x+1}{x^{1/3}(x^2+x+1)} \dee{x}</m> converges as well.

<answer><p>
false
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
To find the volume of the solid, we cut it into horizontal slices, which are thin circular disks. At height <m>y</m>, the disk has radius <m>x=\frac{1}{y}</m> and thickness <m>\dee{y}</m>, so its volume is <m>\frac{\pi}{y^2}\dee{y}</m>. The base of the solid is at height <m>y=1</m>, and its top is at height <m>y=\frac{1}{a}</m>. So, the volume of the entire solid is:
<md>
<mrow>
\int_1^{1/a} \frac{\pi}{y^2}\dee{y} = \left[-\frac{\pi}{y}\right]_1^{1/a} = \pi (1-a)
</mrow>
</md>
If we imagine sliding <m>a</m> closer and closer to 0, the volume increases, getting closer and closer to <m>\pi</m> units, but never quite reaching it.
</p>

<p>So, the statement is false. For example, if we set <m>M=4</m>, no matter which <m>a</m> we choose our solid has volume strictly less than <m>M</m>.
</p>

<p>Remark: we've seen before that <m>\int_0^1 \frac{1}{x}\,\dee{x}</m> diverges. If we imagine the solid that would result from choosing <m>a=0</m>, it would have a scant volume of <m>\pi</m> cubic units, but a silhouette (side view) of infinite area.

<li> First, we notice there is only one <q>source of impropriety:</q>  the domain of integration is infinite.  (The integrand has a singularity at <m>t=1</m>, but this is not in the domain of integration, so it's not a problem for us.)
</li>
<li> We should try to get some intuition about whether the integral converges or diverges.  When <m>t \to \infty</m>, notice the integrand <q>looks like</q> the function <m>\frac{1}{t^4}</m>. We know <m>\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{t^4} \dee{t}</m> converges, because it's a <m>p</m>-integral with <m>p=4 \gt 1</m> (see Example<nbsp/><xref ref="eg_IMPp1"/>). So, our integral probably converges as well. If we were only asked show it converges, we could use a comparison test, but we're asked more than that.
</li>
<li> Since we guess the integral converges, we'll need to evaluate it. The integrand is a rational function, and there's no obvious substitution, so we use partial fractions.

Is the integral <m>\displaystyle\int_0^\infty\frac{\sin^4 x}{x^2}\, \dee{x}</m>
convergent or divergent? Explain why.
</p></statement>

<hint><p>
What is the limit of the integrand when <m>x\rightarrow 0</m>?
</p></hint>

<answer><p>
The integral converges.
</p></answer>

<solution><p>
The integrand is positive everywhere. So either the integral
converges to some finite number or it is infinite. There are two potential
<q>sources of impropriety</q> <mdash/> a possible singularity at <m>x=0</m> and
the fact that the domain of integration extends to <m>\infty</m>.
So, we split up the integral.
<me>
\int_0^\infty\frac{\sin^4 x}{x^2}\, \dee{x}
=\int_0^1\frac{\sin^4 x}{x^2}\, \dee{x}
  + \int_1^\infty\frac{\sin^4 x}{x^2}\, \dee{x}
</me>
</p>

<p>Let's consider the first integral. By l'Hôpital's rule (see the CLP-1 text),
<me>
\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x}
=\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\cos x}{1}
=\cos 0
=1
</me>
Consequently,
<me>
\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\sin^4 x}{x^2}
=\Big(\lim_{x\to 0} \sin^2 x \Big)
\Big(\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} \Big)
\Big(\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} \Big)
=0\times 1\times 1
=0
</me>
and the first integral is not even improper.
</p>

<p>Now for the second integral. Since <m>|\sin x|\le 1</m>, we'll compare it to <m>\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^2}</m>.
<ul>
<li> <m>\frac{\sin^4 x}{x^2}</m> and <m>\frac{1}{x^2}</m> are defined and continuous for every <m>x \geq 1</m>
</li>
<li> <m>0 \leq \frac{\sin^4 x}{x^2} \leq \frac{1^4}{x^2} = \frac{1}{x^2}</m> for every <m>x \geq 1</m>
</li>
<li> <m>\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^2} \dee{x}</m> converges by Example<nbsp/><xref ref="eg_IMPp1"/> (it's a <m>p</m>-type integral with <m>p \gt 1</m>)
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>By the comparison test, Theorem<nbsp/><xref ref="thm_IMPcomparison"/>,
<m>\displaystyle\int_1^\infty\frac{\sin^4 x}{x^2}\, \dee{x}</m> converges.
</p>

<p>Since <m>\displaystyle\int_0^1\frac{\sin^4 x}{x^2}\, \dee{x}</m> and <m>\displaystyle\int_1^\infty\frac{\sin^4 x}{x^2}\, \dee{x}</m> both converge, we conclude
<m>\displaystyle\int_0^\infty\frac{\sin^4 x}{x^2}\, \dee{x}</m> converges as well.

<solution><p>
Since the denominator is positive for all <m>x \geq 0</m>, the integrand is continuous over <m>[0, \infty)</m>. So, the only <q>source of impropriety</q> is the infinite domain of integration.

Solution 1: Let's try to use a direct comparison. Note <m>\dfrac{x}{e^x + \sqrt{x}} \geq 0</m> whenever <m>x \geq 0</m>. Also note that, for large values of <m>x</m>, <m>e^x</m> is much larger than <m>\sqrt{x}</m>. That leads us to consider the following inequalty:

0\leq \dfrac{x}{e^x + \sqrt{x}}  \leq \dfrac{x}{e^x }</me>
</p>

<p>If <m>\int_0^\infty \frac{x}{e^x} \dee{x}</m> converges, we're in business. Let's figure it out. The integrand looks like a candidate for integration by parts: take <m>u=x</m>, <m>\dee{v} = e^{-x} \dee{x}</m>, so <m>\dee{u}=\dee{x}</m> and <m>v=-e^{-x}</m>.

</mrow>
</md>
Using l'Hôpital's rule, we see <m>\int_0^\infty \frac{x}{e^x} \dee{x}</m> converges.  All together:
<ul>
<li> <m>\frac{x}{e^x}</m> and <m>\frac{x}{e^x+\sqrt{x}}</m> are defined and continuous for all <m>x \geq 0</m>,
</li>
<li> <m>\left|\frac{x}{e^x+\sqrt{x}}\right|\leq \frac{x}{e^x}</m>, and
</li>
<li> <m>\int_0^\infty \frac{x}{e^x} \dee{x}</m> converges.
</li>
</ul>
So, by Theorem<nbsp/><xref ref="thm_IMPcomparison"/>, our integral <m>\displaystyle\int_0^\infty \frac{x}{e^x+\sqrt{x}}  \dee{x}</m> converges.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
Solution 2:
Let's try to use a different direct comparison from Solution 1, and avoid integration by parts.
We'd like to compare to something like <m>\dfrac{1}{e^x}</m>, but the inequality goes the wrong way. So, we make a slight modification: we consider <m>2e^{-x/2}</m>. To that end, we claim <m>x \lt 2e^{x/2}</m> for all <m>x \geq 0</m>. We can prove this by noting the following two facts:
<ul>
<li> <m>0 \lt 2=2e^{0/2}</m>, and
</li>
<li>  <m>\diff{}{x}\{x\} = 1 \le e^{x/2} = \diff{}{x}\{2e^{x/2}\}</m>.
</li>
</ul>
So, when <m>x=0</m>, <m>x  \lt  2e^{x/2}</m>, and then as <m>x</m> increases, <m>2e^{x/2}</m> grows faster than <m>x</m>.
</p>

<p>Now we can make the following comparison:
<md>
<mrow>
0\leq \dfrac{x}{e^x + \sqrt{x}}  &amp;\leq \dfrac{x}{e^x }  \lt \frac{2e^{x/2}}{e^x} = \frac{2}{e^{x/2}}
</mrow>
<intertext>We have a hunch that <m>\int_0^\infty \frac{2}{e^{x/2}} \dee{x}</m> converges, just like <m>\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{e^{x}} \dee{x}</m>. This is easy enough to prove. We can guess an antiderivative, or use the substitution <m>u=x/2</m>.
</intertext><mrow>
\int_0^\infty \frac{2}{e^{x/2}} \dee{x}&amp;=\lim_{R \to \infty} \int_0^R \frac{2}{e^{x/2}} \dee{x} =\lim_{R \to \infty} \left[- \frac{4}{e^{x/2}}\right]_0^R
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=\lim_{R \to \infty} \left[\frac{4}{e^{0}}- \frac{4}{e^{R/2}}\right]_0^R=4
</mrow>
</md>
Now we know:
<ul>
<li> <m>0 \leq \frac{x}{e^x+\sqrt{x}} \leq \frac{2}{e^{x/2}}</m>, and
</li>
<li> <m>\int_0^\infty \frac{2}{e^{x/2}} \dee{x}</m> converges.
</li>
<li> Furthermore,  <m>\frac{x}{e^x+\sqrt{x}}</m> and <m>\frac{2}{e^{x/2}}</m> are defined and continuous for all <m>x \geq 0</m>.
</li>
</ul>
By the comparison test (Theorem<nbsp/><xref ref="thm_IMPcomparison"/>), we conclude the integral converges.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Solution 3: Let's use the limiting comparison test (Theorem<nbsp/><xref ref="thm_IMPcomparisonLim"/>).
We have a hunch that our integral behaves similarly to <m>\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{e^x}\,\dee{x}</m>, which converges (see Example<nbsp/><xref ref="eg_IMPp6"/>). Unfortunately, if we choose <m>g(x) = \frac{1}{e^x}</m> (and, of course, <m>f(x) = \frac{x}{e^x+\sqrt{x}}</m>), then
<me>
\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} =
\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{x}{e^x+\sqrt{x}}\cdot e^x =
\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{x}{1+\underbrace{\tfrac{\sqrt{x}}{e^x}}_{\to 0}} = \infty</me>
</p>

<p>That is, the limit does not exist, so the limiting comparison test does not apply. (To find <m>\lim\limits_{x \to \infty}\frac{\sqrt{x}}{e^x}</m>, you can use l'Hôpital's rule.)
</p>

<p>This setback encourages us to try a slightly different angle. If <m>g(x)</m> gave larger values, then we could decrease <m>\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m>. So, let's try <m>g(x) = \frac{1}{e^{x/2}} = e^{-x/2}</m>. Now,
<md>
<mrow>
\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} &amp;=
\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{x}{e^x+\sqrt{x}}\div \frac{1}{e^{x/2}}=
\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{x}{e^{x/2}+\frac{\sqrt{x}}{e^{x/2}}}
</mrow>
</md>
Hmm... this looks hard. Instead of dealing with it directly, let's use the squeeze theorem (see CLP-1 notes).
<md>
<mrow>
0 \leq \frac{x}{e^{x/2}+\frac{\sqrt{x}}{e^{x/2 }}}\leq \frac{x}{e^{x/2}}
</mrow>
</md>
Using l'Hôpital's rule,
<me>
\lim_{x \to \infty} \underbrace{\frac{x}{e^{x/2}}}_{\atp{\mathrm{num}\to \infty}{\mathrm{den}\to\infty}} = \lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}e^{x/2}}=0 = \lim_{x \to \infty}0</me>
</p>

<p>So, by the squeeze theorem <m>\lim\limits_{x \to 0}\frac{\frac{x}{e^x+\sqrt{x}}}{\frac{1}{e^{x/2}}}=0</m>. Since this limit exists, <m>\frac{1}{e^{x/2}}</m> is a reasonable function to use in the limiting comparison test (provided its integral converges). So, we need to show that <m>\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{e^{x/2}}\,\dee{x}</m> converges. This can be done by simply evaluating it:
</p>

<p>
<md>
<mrow>
\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{e^{x/2}}\,\dee{x} \amp= \lim_{b \to \infty}\int_0^b {e^{-x/2}}\,\dee{x}
= \lim_{b \to \infty} -\frac{1}{2}\big[e^{-x/2}\big]_0^b
</mrow><mrow>
\amp= \lim_{b \to \infty} -\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{1}{e^{b/2}}-1\right] = \frac{1}{2}
</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>So, all together:
<ul>
<li> The functions <m>\frac{x}{e^x+\sqrt{x}}</m> and <m>\frac{1}{e^{x/2}}</m> are defined and continuous for all <m>x \geq 0</m>, and <m>\frac{1}{e^{x/2}} \ge 0</m> for all <m>x \ge 0</m>.
</li>
<li> <m>\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{e^{x/2}}\,\dee{x}</m> converges.
</li>
<li> The limit <m>\lim\limits_{x \to \infty}\frac{\frac{x}{e^x}+\sqrt{x}}{\frac{1}{e^{x/2}}}</m> exists (it's equal to 0).
</li>
<li> So, the limiting comparison test (Theorem<nbsp/><xref ref="thm_IMPcomparison"/>) tells us that <m>\int_0^\infty \frac{x}{e^x+\sqrt{x}}\,\dee{x}</m> converges as well.
</li>
</ul>

<statement><p>
Let <m>M_{n,t}</m> be the Midpoint Rule approximation for
<m>\displaystyle\int_0^t \frac{e^{-x}}{1+x}\dee{x}</m> with <m>n</m> equal subintervals.
Find a value of <m>t</m> and a value of <m>n</m> such that <m>M_{n,t}</m> differs
from  <m>\int_0^\infty \frac{e^{-x}}{1+x}\dee{x}</m> by at most <m>10^{-4}</m>.
Recall that the error <m>E_n</m> introduced when the Midpoint
Rule is used with <m>n</m> subintervals obeys
<md>
<mrow>
|E_n|\le \frac{M(b-a)^3}{24n^2}

</md>
where <m>M</m> is the maximum absolute value of the second derivative of the

</p></statement>

<hint><p>
There are two things that contribute to your error: using <m>t</m> as the upper bound instead of infinity, and using <m>n</m> intervals for the approximation.
</p>

<p>First, find a <m>t</m> so that the error introduced by approximating
<m>\int_0^\infty \frac{e^{-x}}{1+x}\dee{x}</m> by <m>\int_0^t \frac{e^{-x}}{1+x}\dee{x}</m>
is at most <m>\frac{1}{2} 10^{-4}</m>. Then, find your <m>n</m>.
</p></hint>

<answer><p>
<m>t=10</m> and <m>n= 2042</m> will do the job.
There are many other correct answers.
</p></answer>

<solution><p>
There are two sources of error: the upper bound is <m>t</m>, rather than infinity, and we're using an approximation with some finite number of intervals, <m>n</m>. Our plan is to first find a value of <m>t</m> that introduces an error of no more than <m>\frac{1}{2}10^{-4}</m>. That is, we'll find a value of <m>t</m> such that <m>\int_t^\infty \frac{e^{-x}}{1+x} \dee{x} \leq \frac{1}{2}10^{-4}</m>. After that, we'll find a value of <m>n</m> that approximates <m>\int_0^t \frac{e^{-x}}{x+1} \dee{x}</m> to within <m>\frac{1}{2}10^{-4}</m>. Then, all together, our  error will be at most <m>\frac{1}{2}10^{-4} + \frac{1}{2}10^{-4} = 10^{-4}</m>, as desired. (Note we could have broken up the error in another way<mdash/>it didn't have to be <m>\frac{1}{2}10^{-4}</m> and <m>\frac{1}{2}10^{-4}</m>. This will give us one of many possible answers.)
</p>

<p>Let's  find a <m>t</m> such that
<m>\int_t^\infty  \frac{e^{-x}}{1+x}\dee{x}\le\frac{1}{2} 10^{-4}</m>.
For all <m>x\ge 0</m>,
<m>0 \lt \frac{e^{-x}}{1+x}\le e^{-x}</m>, so
<md>
<mrow>
\int_t^\infty  \frac{e^{-x}}{1+x}\dee{x}
\le \int_t^\infty e^{-x}\dee{x}

t&amp;\ge -\log\Big(\frac{1}{2} 10^{-4}\Big)\approx 9.90
</mrow>
</md>
Choose, for example, <m>t=10</m>.
</p>

<p>Now it's time to decide how many intervals we're going to use to approximate <m>\displaystyle\int_0^t \frac{e^{-x}}{x+1} \dee{x}</m>. Again, we want our error to be less than <m>\frac{1}{2}10^{-4}</m>. To bound our error, we need to know the second derivative of <m>\frac{e^{-x}}{x+1}</m>.
<md>
<mrow>
f(x)=\frac{e^{-x}}{1+x}
\amp\implies f'(x)=-\frac{e^{-x}}{1+x}-\frac{e^{-x}}{(1+x)^2}

\amp\implies f''(x)=\frac{e^{-x}}{1+x}+2\frac{e^{-x}}{(1+x)^2}

Since <m>f''(x)</m> is positive, and decreases as <m>x</m> increases,
<md>
<mrow>
|f''(x)|\le f''(0) = 5
\implies |E_n|\le\frac{5(10-0)^3}{24n^2}=\frac{5000}{24n^2}

</mrow>
</md>
and <m>|E_n|\le \frac{1}{2} 10^{-4}</m> if
<md alignment="alignat">
  <mrow>
&amp;&amp;\frac{625}{3n^2}&amp;\le \frac{1}{2} 10^{-4}

True or false:

There is some real number <m>x</m>, with <m>x \geq 1</m>, such that <m>\displaystyle\int_0^x \frac{1}{e^t} \dee{t} = 1</m>.

false

<solution><p>
Define <m>F(x)=
\int_0^x \frac{1}{e^{t}}\dee{t}</m>.
<md>
<mrow>
F(x)=\int_0^x \frac{1}{e^{t}}\dee{t}&amp;=\left[-\frac{1}{e^{t}}\right]_0^x

</p>

<p>We note here that <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x \to \infty} \int_0^x\frac{1}{e^{t}}\dee{t}=1</m>. So, as <m>x</m> grows larger, the gap between <m>F(x)</m> and 1 grows infintesimally small. But there is no real value of <m>x</m> where <m>F(x)</m> is exactly equal to 1.
