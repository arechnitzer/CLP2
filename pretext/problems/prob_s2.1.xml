<statement><p>
Find the work (in joules) required to lift a 3-gram block of matter a height of 10 centimetres against the force of gravity (with <m>g=9.8</m> m/sec<m>^2</m>).
</p></statement>
<hint><p>
Watch your units: <m>1 \,\mathrm{J} = 1\, \frac{\mathrm{kg}\cdot\mathrm{m}^2}{\mathrm{sec}^2}</m>, but your mass is not given in kilograms, and your height is not given in metres.
</p></hint>
<answer><p>
0.00294 J
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
Force is mass <m>\times</m> acceleration (with acceleration equal to <m>g</m> in this problem), and both in this scenario are constant, so we don't need an integral <mdash/> only a product <mdash/> to calculate the force acting on the block.
</p>

<p>To find the force in newtons, recall one newton is one <m>\frac{\text{kg}\cdot\text{m}}{\text{sec}^2}</m>, so we need the mass of our block in kg. Specifically, our block has mass <m>\frac{3}{1000}</m> kg. So, the force involved is
<me>
F=\left(\frac{3}{1000}\text{ kg}\right)\times\left(9.8 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{sec}^2}\right) = 0.0294 \frac{\text{kg}\cdot\text{m}}{\text{sec}^2} = 0.0294 \text{N}</me>
</p>

<p>To find the work in joules, recall one joule is one newton-metre: that is, one newton of force acting over one metre. So, we need our distance in metres.
<me>
W = \big( 0.0294 \text{N}\big)\times\left(\frac{1}{10} \text{m}\right) = 0.00294 \text{N}\cdot\text{m} = 0.00294 \text{J}</me>
</p>

<exercise purpose="RQS">
<statement><p>
A rock exerts a force of 1 N on the ground where it sits due to  gravity. Use <m>g=9.8</m> m/sec<m>^2</m>.
</p>

<p>What is the mass of the rock?
</p>

<p>How much work (in joules) does it take to lift that rock one metre in the air?
</p></statement>
<hint><p>
The force of the rock on the ground is the product of its mass and the acceleration due to gravity.
</p></hint>
<answer><p>
The rock has mass <m>\dfrac{1}{9.8}</m> kg (about 102 grams); lifting it one metre takes 1 J of work.
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
The force of the rock is one newton, or one kilogram-metre per second squared, so
<me>
1 \frac{\text{kg}\cdot\text{m}}{\text{sec}^2} = (x \text{kg})\left(9.8 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{sec}^2}\right)</me>
</p>

<p>Therefore, the mass of the rock is <m>\frac{1}{9.8} </m> kg, or about 102 grams.
</p>

<p>Now, since one joule is one newton-metre, the amount of work required to counteract 1 N of gravitational force for one metre is precisely one joule.
</p>

<p>Remark:  having an idea of how much work a joule is, and how much force a newton is, is a good tool for checking the reasonableness of your work. For example, after this question, if you calculate that a marble weighs 100 N, you can be pretty sure there's an error in your calculation.

<statement><p>
Consider the equation
<me>
W = \int_a^b F(x)\,\dee{x}</me>
</p>

<p>where <m>x</m> is measured in metres and <m>F(x)</m> is measured in kilogram-metres per second squared (newtons).
</p>

<p>For some large <m>n</m>, we might approximate
<me>
W \approx \sum_{i=1}^n F(x_i)\Delta x </me>
</p>

<p>where <m>\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}</m> and <m>x_i</m> is some number in the interval <m>[a+(i-1)\Delta x, a+i\Delta x]</m>. (This is just the general form of a Riemann sum).

<li> What are the units of <m>\Delta x</m>?

<li> What are the units of <m>F(x_i)</m>?

<li> Using your answers above, what are the units of <m>W</m>?
</li>
</ol>
Remark: we already know the units of <m>W</m> from the text, but the Riemann sum illustrates <em>why they make sense</em> arising from this particular integral.
</p></statement>
<hint><p>
Adding or subtracting two quantities of the same units doesn't change the units. For example, if I have one metre of rope, and I tie on two more metres of rope, I have <m>1+2=3</m> metres of rope <mdash/> not 3 centimetres of rope, or 3 kilograms of rope.
</p>

<p>Multiplying or dividing quantities of some units gives rise to a quantity with the product or quotient of those units. For example, if I buy ten pounds of salmon for <m>\$</m>50, the price of my salmon is <m>\dfrac{50\text{ dollars} }{10\text{ pounds}} = \dfrac{50}{10} \frac{\text{dollars}}{\text{pound}} = 5 \frac{\text{dollars}}{\text{pound}}</m>. (Not 5 pound-dollars, or 5 pounds.)

<answer><p>
(a) metres
</p><p>
(b) newtons
</p><p>
(c) joules
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
<ol label="a">
<li>
<p>
We defined <m>\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}</m>:  that is, the length of one interval, when we chop <m>[a,b]</m> into <m>n</m> of them. If <m>b</m> and <m>a</m> are measured in metres, then <m>\Delta x</m> is measured in metres as well. So, the units of <m>\Delta x</m> are metres.
</p>

<p>Put another way, since <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> both describe a quantity in metres, <m>b-a</m> describes a quantity in metres as well. (When we add or subtract quantities of the same units, their sum or difference is given in the same units.) Since <m>n</m> is a unitless quantity (simply a number: not <q><m>n</m> kg</q> or <q><m>n</m> m</q>), <m>\frac{b-a}{n}</m> still describes a quantity in metres. (If I have 6 metres of cloth, and I cut it into 3 pieces, each piece has <m>\frac{6}{3}=2</m> metres <mdash/> not 2 kilograms, or 2 metres per second.)
</p>
</li>
<li> Since <m>F(x)</m> is measured in kilogram-metres per second squared (newtons), the units of <m>F(x_i)</m> are kilogram-metres per second squared (newtons).
</li>
<li> <m>W</m> is calculated by adding up summands of the form <m>F(x_i)\Delta x</m>. The units of <m>F(x_i)\Delta x</m> are the products of the units of <m>F(x_i)</m> with the units of <m>\Delta x</m>. That is, the units of <m>F(x_i)\Delta x</m> are <m>\left(\frac{\text{kg}\cdot\text{m}}{\text{sec}^2}\right)\left(\text{m}\right) = \frac{\text{kg}\cdot\text{m}^2}{\text{sec}^2} = J</m>. The sum of terms given in joules is itself given in joules, so the units of <m>W</m> are joules.

<statement><p>
You want to weigh your luggage  before a flight. You don't have a scale or balance, but you do have a heavy-duty spring from your local engineering-supply store. You nail it to your wall, marking where the bottom hangs. You hang a one-litre bag of water (with mass one kilogram)  from the spring, and observe that the spring stretches 1 cm. Where on the wall should you mark the bottom of the spring corresponding to a hanging mass of 10kg?

You may assume that the spring obeys Hooke's law.
</p></statement>
<hint><p>
Hooke's law says that the force required to stretch a spring <m>x</m> units past its natural length is proportional to <m>x</m>; that is, there is some constant <m>k</m> associated with the individual spring such that the force required to stretch it <m>x</m> m past its natural length is <m>kx</m>.
</p></hint>
<answer><p>
10 cm below the bottom of the unloaded spring
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
Hooke's law says that the force required to stretch a spring <m>x</m> units past its natural length is proportional to <m>x</m>; that is, there is some constant <m>k</m> associated with the individual spring such that the force required to stretch it <m>x</m> m past its natural length is <m>kx</m>.
<ul>
<li>Solution 1:
Since the force required to stretch the spring is proportional to the amount stretched, and the force acting on the spring is proportional to the mass hanging from it, we conclude the amount the spring stretches is proportional to the mass hung from it. So, if 1 kg stretches it 1 cm, then 10 kg will stretch it 10 cm. We should mark the wall 10 cm below the bottom of the spring as it hangs unloaded.
</li>
<li>
<p>
Solution 2:
We can find <m>k</m> from the test with the bag of water. The force exerted by the bag of water was <m>(1\text{ kg})(9.8\text{ m/sec}^2) = 9.8</m> N<m>=k(1 \text{ cm})</m>. So,
<me>
k = \frac{9.8 \frac{\text{kg}\cdot\text{m}}{\text{sec}^2}}{0.01\text{ m}} = 980 \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{sec}^2}</me>
</p>

<p>If we hang 10 kg from the spring, gravity exerts a force of <m>(10 \text{ kg})(9.8 \text{ m/sec}^2) = 98 \frac{\text{kg}\cdot\text{m}}{\text{sec}^2}</m>. This will be matched by the spring with a force of <m>kx</m> newtons, where <m>k</m> is the spring constant and <m>x</m> is the amount stretched.
<md>
<mrow>
kx&amp;=98 \frac{\text{kg}\cdot\text{m}}{\text{sec}^2}

\left(980 \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{sec}^2}\right)\left(x\text{ m}\right)&amp;=98 \frac{\text{kg}\cdot\text{m}}{\text{sec}^2}
</mrow><mrow>
x&amp;=\frac{1}{10}\text{ m} = 10\text{ cm}
</mrow>
</md>
So, we should put the mark at 10 cm below the natural length of the spring.

Be careful about the units.
</p></hint>

<answer><p>
<m>25</m> J
</p></answer>

<solution><p>
First note that newtons and joules are SI units with one joule equal to one newton-metre, so we should
measure distances in meters rather than centimeters.
Next recall that a spring with spring constant <m>k</m>
exerts a force <m>F(x)=kx</m> when the spring is stretched  <m>x</m> m beyond its
natural length. So in this case <m>(0.05\text{ m})( k) =10 \text{ N}</m>, or <m>k=200</m> N/m. The work done is:

<mrow>
\int_0^{0.5\ \mathrm{m}} F(x)\dee{x}
=\int_0^{0.5} 200 x\dee{x}

Note the units of the integrand (<m>F(x) = kx=200x</m>) are newtons (<m>k</m> is given in N/m, and <m>x</m> is given in m). The units of the variable of integration, <m>x</m> are metres. So, the evaluated integral has units newton-metres, or joules.

Note that the cable has mass density <m>\frac{8}{5}</m> kg/m.
When the bucket is at height <m>y</m>, the cable that remains to be lifted has length <m>(5-y)</m> m
and mass <m>\frac{8}{5}(5-y)=8\big(1-\frac{y}{5}\big)</m> kg.
So, at height <m>y</m>, the cable is subject to a downward gravitational force
of <m>8\big(1-\frac{y}{5}\big)\cdot9.8</m> N; to raise the cable we need
to apply a compensating upward force of <m>8\big(1-\frac{y}{5}\big)\cdot9.8</m> N.
So, the work required is
<md>
<mrow>
\int_0^{5}8\Big(1-\frac{y}{5}\Big)\cdot9.8\,\dee{y}
\amp=8\bigg[\Big(y-\frac{y^2}{10}\Big)\cdot9.8\bigg]_0^{5}
</mrow><mrow>
\amp=8\cdot 2.5\cdot 9.8 \quad\text{ N}\cdot\text{m}= 196\ \mathrm{J}.

</md>
</p>

<p>Alternatively, the cable has linear density <m>8</m> kg<m>{}/5</m> m<m>{}= 1.6</m> kg<m>{}/{}</m>m, and so the work required to lift a small piece of the cable (of length <m>\Delta y</m>) from height <m>y</m> m to height <m>5</m> m is
<me>
\underbrace{\underbrace{1.6\Delta y}_{\text{mass}}\cdot\underbrace{9.8\vphantom{y}}_{\text{gravity}}}_{\text{force}}\cdot\underbrace{(5-y)}_{\text{distance}}.</me>
 The total work required is therefore

We can model the sculpture as a collection of thin horizontal plates of width <m>\dee{z}</m>. Remember work is force times distance; a horizontal plate at height <m>z</m> moved <m>z+2</m> metres from the basement to its final position. So, we need to know the force acting on the plate, which is the product of the mass of the plate with the acceleration due to gravity.

Suppose a spring extends 5 cm past its natural length when one kilogram is hung from its end. How much work is done to extend the spring from 5 cm past its natural length to 7 cm past its natural length?

You can find the spring constant <m>k</m> from the information about the hanging kilogram.
</p></hint>
<answer><p>
0.2352 J
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
From the information given about the hanging kilogram, we can find the spring constant <m>k</m>. One kilogram generates a force of <m>9.8</m> N under  gravity. (We find this by the calculation <m>(1\text{ kg})\times(9.8 \text{m/sec}^2)=9.8\text{ N}</m>.) This force is matched by the force of the spring, which by Hooke's law is equal to <m>k(\frac{1}{20} \text{m})</m>. So,
<me>
k = \frac{9.8 \text{ N}}{\frac{1}{20} \text{ m} } = 196  \frac{\text{N}}{\text{m}}</me>
</p>

<p>Again by Hooke's law, the force required to stretch the spring <m>x</m> metres past its natural length is <m>196x</m> N (when <m>x</m> is measured in metres).
</p>

<p>So, the work required to stretch the spring from 5 cm past its natural length to 7 cm past its natural length is
<me>
W = \int_{0.05}^{0.07} 196 x\,\dee{x} = \big[98x^2\big]_{0.05}^{0.07}=0.2352\text{ J}</me>

<m>\dfrac{20}{49}</m> kg, or about 408 grams
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
Let <m>M</m> be the mass of the rope. Then its density is <m>\frac{M}{4}</m> kg/m. Following the method of Example<nbsp/><xref ref="eg_WKcable"/>, we let <m>y</m> be the height of the firewood above the ground, so the wood is raised from <m>y=0</m> to <m>y=4</m>. When the wood is at height <m>y</m>,
<ul>
<li> the rope that remains to be lifted has length <m>4-y</m>, and so it has mass <m>\frac{M}{4}(4-y) </m> kg,
</li>
<li> and the firewood still has mass 10 kg.
</li>
<li> The remaining rope and the wood are subject to a downward gravitational force of magnitude <m>\underbrace{\left[\frac{M}{4}(4-y)+10\right]}_{\text{mass}}\times\, 9.8\quad</m> N.
</li>
<li> So, to raise the firewood from height <m>y</m> to height <m>(y+\dee{y})</m>, we need to apply a compensating upward force of <m>\left[\frac{M}{4}(4-y)+10\right]\times 9.8</m> through distance <m>\dee{y}</m>. This takes work <m>\left[\frac{M}{4}(4-y)+10\right]\times 9.8\,\dee{y}</m> J.
</li>
</ul>
All together, the work involved in hauling up the wood is
<md>
<mrow>
\int_0^4\left(\left[\frac{M}{4}(4-y)+10\right]\times 9.8\right)\dee{y}

</mrow><mrow>
\amp=9.8(2M+40) \text{ J}

</md>
</p>

<p>Since the work was 400 joules, solving <m>400=9.8(2M+40)</m> for <m>M</m> tells us the mass of the rope is <m>\frac{200}{9.8}-20 = \frac{20}{49}</m> kg, or about 408 g.
</p>

<p>Alternately, the work involved in lifting up the wood is <m>10\times 9.8 \times 4 = 392</m> J, so the work in lifting up the rope is 8 J. A small section of rope of length <m>\dee{y}</m>, that starts at height <m>y</m> above the ground, has mass <m>\frac{M}{4}\dee{y}</m> kg and is lifted <m>(4-y)</m> metres, so the work involved in lifting this section of rope is <m>9.8 \times (4-y) \times \frac{M}{4}\dee y</m>. Then the amount of work to lift the whole rope (but not the wood) is
<md>
<mrow>
8 \text{ J} \amp= \int_0^4 \left(9.8 \times (4-y) \times \frac{M}{4}\right)\dee y  = \frac{9.8 \times M}{4}\int_0^4 (4-y)\dee{y} 
</mrow><mrow>
\amp= \frac{9.8 \times M}{4}\times 8

<solution><p>
For Questions<nbsp/><xref ref="prob_s2_1cable" text="local"/> and <xref ref="prob_s2_1firewood" text="local"/> in this section, we gave two methods for finding the work involved in pulling up a cable: one where we consider pulling up the entire remaining cable a tiny distance of <m>\dee{y}</m>, and one where we consider pulling a tiny slice of cable of length <m>\dee{y}</m> the entire distance up.
</p>

<p>There is another variation we can consider with the weight: we can either calculate the work done on the weight and the work done on the rope separately, or we can calculate them together. If we calculate them together, then there are two cases to consider: the work done pulling up the first 5 metres of rope involves the weight, while the last 5 metres does not. These two choices (how to model the rope, and how to deal with the weight) actually lead to four solutions, but to avoid unnecessary repetition only two are presented below.
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Solution 1: In this solution, we consider the work on the rope separately from work on the weight, and we imagine lifting a tiny piece of rope the entire distance to the window.
</p>

<p>The weight has a mass of 5 kg, and is lifted a distance of 5 m to the window. The force of gravity acting on the weight is <m>(5 \text{ kg})(9.8 \text{ m/sec}^2) = 49</m> N, so the work to lift it 5 metres is <m>(49\text{ N})(5\text{ m}) = \textcolor{red}{245}\text{J}</m>.

<statement><p>
A ball of mass 1 kg is attached to a spring, and the spring is attached to a table. The ball moves with some initial velocity, and the spring slows it down. At its farthest, the spring stretches 10 cm past its natural length. If the spring constant is 5 N/m, what was the initial velocity of the ball?

You may assume that the ball starts moving with initial velocity <m>v_0</m>, and that the only force slowing it down is the spring. You may also assume that the spring started out at its natural length, it follows Hooke's law, and when it is stretched its farthest, the velocity of the ball is 0 m/sec.
</p></statement>
<hint><p>
Remember that the work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy, which is <m>\frac{1}{2}mv^2</m>, where <m>m</m> is the mass of the object and <m>v</m> is its velocity. Hooke's law will tell you how much work was done stretching the spring.
</p></hint>
<answer><p>
<m>\dfrac{1}{2\sqrt{5}}</m> m/sec, or about 22.36 cm/sec
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
Definition<nbsp/><xref ref="def_WKwork"/>  in the text is justified by showing that the work done by a force acting on a particle is  equal to the change in the kinetic energy of that particle. We can use Hooke's law to calculate the work done stretching the spring. That work will be equal to the change in kinetic energy of the ball.
</p>

<p>The ball initially has kinetic energy <m>\frac{1}{2}(1\text{ kg})(v_0 \text{ m/sec})^2 = \frac{v_0^2}{2} \frac{\text{kg}\cdot\text{m}^2}{\text{sec}^2} = \frac{v_0^2}{2}\text{ J}</m>.  At the time the spring is stretched its farthest, the ball's velocity is 0 m/sec, so its kinetic energy is <m>\frac{1}{2}(1\text{ kg})(0 \text{ m/sec})^2 =0 \text{J}</m>. So, the change in kinetic energy of the ball is <m>\frac{v_0^2}{2}</m> J.
</p>

<p>Now let's find the work done by the spring. Its spring constant is <m>k=5</m> N/m, so, the force on the spring when it is stretched <m>x</m> metres past its natural length is <m>5x</m> N. The spring is stretched from its natural length to 10 cm, which is 0.1 m. Then the work done by the spring is

<mrow>
W&amp;=\int_0^{0.1} kx \dee{x}= \int_0^{0.1} 5x\,\dee{x} = \left[\frac{5}{2}x^2\right]_0^{0.1} = \frac{1}{40} \text{ J}

</md>
</p>

<p>Now we can find <m>v_0</m>.
<md>
<mrow>
\frac{v_0^2}{2} =\frac{1}{40} \qquad \implies \qquad v_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{20}} \text{ m/sec} \approx 22.36 \text{ cm/sec}

<statement><p>
A mild-mannered university professor who is definitely not a spy notices that when their car is on the ground, it is 2 cm shorter than when it is on a jack. (That is: when the car is on a jack, its struts are at their natural length; when on the ground, the weight of the car causes the struts to compress 2 cm.) The university professor calculates that if they were to jump a local neighborhood drawbridge, their car would fall to the ground with a speed of 4 m/sec. If the car can sag 20 cm before important parts scrape the ground, and the car has mass 2000 kg unoccupied (2100 kg with the professor inside), can the professor, who is certainly not involved in international intrigue, safely jump the  bridge?
</p>

<p>Assume the car falls vertically, the struts obey Hooke's law, and the work done by the struts is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the car + professor. Use 9.8 m/sec<m>^2</m> for  the acceleration due to gravity.
</p></statement>
<hint><p>
As in Question<nbsp/><xref ref="prob_s2_1_Work_KE" text="local"/> in this section, the change in kinetic energy of the car is equal to the work done by the compressing struts. The only added step is to calculate the spring constant, given that a car with mass 2000 kg compresses the spring 2 cm in Earth's gravity. You're not calculating <em>work</em> to find the spring constant: you're using the fact that when the car is sitting still, the force exerted upward by the struts is equal to the force exerted downward by the mass of the car under gravity.
</p></hint>
<answer><p>
yes (at least, the car won't scrape the ground)
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
The setup to answer this question is similar to Question<nbsp/><xref ref="prob_s2_1_Work_KE" text="local"/> in this section: the work done by a spring on the occupied vehicle will be equal to the change in kinetic energy of that occupied vehicle. So, we need to find the work done by the spring, and the kinetic energy lost by the falling car. In order to find the work done by the spring, we need to find the spring constant.
</p>

<p><ul>
<li>Spring constant: The car's mass of 2000 kg compresses the struts 2 cm past their natural length. The force of the car under gravity is <m>(2000 \text{ kg})\times(9.8 \text{ m/sec}^2) = 19\,600 </m> N. This force is exactly the same as that exerted by the   spring, <m>k(0.02 \text{ m})</m>. So, <m>k = 980\,000</m> N/m.
</li>
<li>Work done by spring: The spring can safely compress 20 cm. So, the amount of work done by the spring compressing that far gives us the <em>maximum</em> amount of work the spring can safely do. While the car is falling, the spring is at its natural length, so the work done to compress it to 20 cm (0.2 m) shorter is:
<me>
\int_0^{0.2} kx\,\dee{x} = \int_0^{0.2} 980\,000 x\,\dee{x} =\big[490\,000 x^2 \big]_0^{0.2}=19\,600 \text{ J}</me>
</li>
<li>Change in kinetic energy:
When the car first hits the pavement, it's falling at <m>4</m> m/sec, so it has kinetic energy <m>\frac{1}{2}(2100\text{ kg})(4\text{ m/sec})^2 = 16\,800</m> J. When the car compresses the springs as far as they go and it starts to rebound, it has kinetic energy 0, since its instantaneous velocity is zero. So, the change in kinetic energy is
<m>16\,800</m> J.
</li>
</ul>
Since the change in kinetic energy is <m>16\,800</m> J, and the struts can safely do a work of (up to) <m>19\,600</m> J, the jump is within the (meagre) safety limits set by the question.

A horizontal cross-section of the cone is a circle. To find its radius, we use similar triangles: <m>\frac{r}{y} = \frac{0.05}{0.15}</m>, so <m>r=\frac{1}{3}y</m>.

<p>The depth at the top of the plunger is <m>y=0</m>. To find the depth at the bottom of the plunger, note that the water has a volume of 3 m<m>^3</m>, and is in a rectangular container with base 1 m by 3 m. So, its height is 1 m.

<p>Now, let's consider the depth of the water. The volume of water is 3 m<m>^3</m>, and it is in a rectangular container with base 1 m by <m>x</m> m. So, its depth is <m>3/x</m> m.
Therefore, the force on the entire plunger must  be calculated from <m>y=0</m> to <m>y=3/x</m>.

When <m>y</m> metres of rope have been hauled up, what is the mass of the water?

</p></answer>
<solution><p>
Let's start by converting from time spent pulling to amount pulled. When <m>y</m> metres of rope have been pulled up, <m>2y</m> seconds have passed, so <m>\frac{1}{5}y</m> litres of water have leaked out of the bucket, leaving <m>5-\frac{1}{5}y</m> litres.  (This only makes sense when <m>\frac{1}{5}y \leq 5</m>, but we only consider values of <m>y</m> from 0 to 5, so it's not a problem. That is, we're never hauling up an empty bucket that can't leak any more.)
</p>

<p>When we've pulled up <m>y</m> metres of rope, the mass in the bucket is <m>(5-\frac{1}{5}y)</m> kg, so the force of gravity acting on it is <m>9.8(5-\frac{1}{5}y)</m> N. Since we pull up 5 metres of rope, the work done is:

The force of gravity between two objects, one of mass <m>m_1</m> and another of mass <m>m_2</m>, is <m>F = G\dfrac{m_1m_2}{r^2}</m>, where <m>r</m> is the distance between them and <m>G</m> is the gravitational constant.

<p>How much work is required to separate the earth and the moon far enough apart that the gravitational attraction between them is negligible?

<answer><p>
About <m>7 \times 10^{28} \text{ J}</m>
</p></answer>
<solution>

<p>According to the formula for gravity between two objects, the earth and moon will gravitationally attract one another no matter how far apart they are, so what we're looking for is the work to separate them infinitely far. That is, we want to calculate
<m>\displaystyle\int_a^\infty F(r)\,\dee{r}</m>, where <m>a = 400\,000\,000</m> m.
</p>

<p>If we take <m>m_1</m> and <m>m_2</m> to be the mass of the earth and moon as given in the question statement, then:

<p>Remark: since the force of gravity between the earth and the moon gets weaker as they are farther apart, it takes less and less work to move them each kilometre. If we move them a finite distance apart, the work involved will always be less than <m>7\times 10^{28}</m> joules, no matter how huge that finite distance is. If we move them a very, very long (but finite) distance apart, the work we did will be quite close to (but still less than) <m>7\times 10^{28}</m> joules.

You can formulate a guess by considering the work done on the ball versus the work done on the rope in Question<nbsp/><xref ref="prob_s2_1_normal2" text="local"/>, Solution 1. But be careful <mdash/> the ball in that problem did not have the same mass as the rope.
</p></hint>
<answer><p>
true
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
A ball of mass <m>m</m> experiences a gravitational force of <m>mg</m>, so lifting it a height of <m>\ell/2</m> involves a work of <m>\frac{1}{2}mg\ell</m>.
</p>

<p>The cable has density <m>m/\ell</m>. A tiny section of cable with length <m>\dee{y}</m> has mass <m>\frac{m}{\ell}\,\dee{y}</m>, and so gravity acts on it with a force of <m>\frac{mg}{\ell}\,\dee{y}</m>. If the tiny section of cable is <m>y</m> units from the top of the cable, it needs to be pulled up <m>y</m> units, so the work on that section is <m>\frac{mg}{\ell}y\,\dee{y}</m>. Therefore, the work to pull up the entire cable is
<me>
\int_0^\ell \frac{mg}{\ell}y\,\dee{y} = \left[\frac{mg}{2\ell}y^2\right]_0^\ell = \frac{mg}{2\ell}\ell^2 = \frac{1}{2}mg\ell</me>
</p>

<p>So, the work to pull up a cable with uniform density is the same as the work to pull up a ball with the same mass from the middle height of the cable.
</p>

<p>Remark: this is a nice fact to use when you're checking your computations for <q>pulling up cable</q> problems, but keep in mind it depends on the cable being of uniform density.

A tank one metre high is filled with watery mud that has settled to be denser at the bottom than at the top.

At height <m>h</m> metres above the bottom of the tank, the density of the liquid is <m>1000\sqrt{2-h}</m> kilograms per cubic metre.

There are two things that vary with height: the density of the liquid, and the area of the cross-section of the tank.

Like our other tank-pumping problems (e.g. Questions<nbsp/><xref ref="prob_s2_1_tank3" text="local"/>, <xref ref="prob_s2_1_tank2" text="local"/>, and <xref ref="prob_s2_1_tank1" text="local"/> in this section, and Example<nbsp/><xref ref="eg_WKdrum"/> in the text), we can find the work done by considering thin layers of liquid. If the layer of liquid <m>h</m> metres above the bottom of the tank with thickness <m>\dee{h}</m> has mass <m>M(h)</m>, then the force of gravity acting on it is <m>-9.8M(h)</m> N and the work required to pump it to the top of the tank (<m>1-h</m> metres away) is <m>9.8(1-h)M(h)</m> J. So, the work to empty the entire tank is
<me>
W = \int_0^19.8(1-h)M(h) \tag{$*$} </me>
</p>

<p>Our  remaining task is to find <m>M(h)</m>. There are two things that vary with height: the density of the liquid, and the area of the cross-section of the tank.
</p>

<p>At  height <m>h</m> metres, the cross-section of the tank is shaped like the finite region bounded by the curves <m>y=x^2</m> and <m>y=2-h-3x^2</m>. To find this area, we need an integral (see Section 1.5 for a refresher), and to find the limits of integration, we need to know where the two curves meet. By solving <m>x^2 =2-h-3x^2</m>, we find that they meet at <m>x = \pm\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2-h}</m>. (Recall <m>h</m> is between 0 and 1, so <m>\sqrt{2-h}</m> is a real number, i.e. the curves do indeed meet.) Furthermore, when <m>-\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2-h}\le x \le \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2-h}</m>, then <m>x^2 \leq 2-h-3x^2</m>, so <m>y=x^2</m> is the bottom function and <m>2-h-3x^2</m> is the top function.

Assume that the  work done is only moving against gravity, with <m>g=9.8</m> m/sec<m>^2</m>, and the sand has uniform density. Also assume that at the instant the hourglass is flipped over, the sand has not yet begun to fall, as in the picture above.
</p></statement>
<hint><p>
You can model the motion, instead of a rotation, as dividing the sand into thin horizontal slices and lifting each of them to their new position.
<ul>
<li> In order to calculate the work involved lifting a layer of sand, you need to know the mass of the layer of sand.
</li>
<li> To find the mass of a layer of sand, you need its volume and the density of the sand.
</li>
<li> To find the density of the sand, you need to the volume of the sand: that is, the volume of half the hourglass.
</li>
<li> The hourglass is a solid of rotation: you can find its volume using an integral, as in Section 1.6.
</li>
</ul>
</p></hint>
<answer><p>
<m>\displaystyle\frac{7}{40}= 0.175 \text{ J}</m>
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
Since the only work done is against the force of gravity, we only need to know how high the sand was lifted, not how it got there. So, we don't really need to worry about its semicircular path: we can imagine that every grain of sand was lifted from its old position to its new position.
</p>

<p>Consider a thin, horizontal layer of sand in the hourglass, <m>y</m> metres below the vertical centre of the hourglass.
<ul>
<li> Its final position is <m>y</m> metres above the centre of the hourglass. That is, it was lifted <m>2y</m> metres against the force of gravity.
</li>
<li> The layer is shaped like a circle with radius <m>y^2+0.01</m> and height <m>\dee{y}</m>, so its volume is <m>\pi\left(y^2+0.01\right)^2\,\dee{y}</m> cubic metres.
</li>
<li> To find the mass of the layer, we need to know the density of the sand. Let the volume of sand in the hourglass be <m>V</m>. We are given its mass <m>M</m>. Then <m>\pi\left(y^2+0.01\right)^2\,\dee{y}</m> cubic metres has a mass of <m>\frac{M}{V}\pi\left(y^2+0.01\right)^2\,\dee{y}</m> kilograms.
</li>
<li> So, the force of gravity acting on the layer is <m>9.8\frac{M}{V}\pi\left(y^2+0.01\right)^2\,\dee{y}</m> N, acting vertically downwards.
</li>
<li> To lift the layer to its final position, we apply a compensating force over a distance of <m>2y</m> metres, for a total work of <m>9.8\frac{M}{V}\pi\left(y^2+0.01\right)^22y\,\dee{y}</m> J.
</li>
<li> Since the hourglass has height <m>0.2</m> m, and exactly half of it is filled with sand, the top layer of sand is exactly at the vertical centre of the hourglass, and the bottom layer of sand is  0.1 metres below.
</li>
</ul>
Using <m>V</m> is the volume of sand in the hourglass, and <m>M</m> is its mass (we're given <m>M  =\frac{1}{7}</m> kg) then  the total work flipping <em>all</em> the sand is:

In the picture above, we've used an axis that matches the way we've been describing our solid: <m>0</m> is the vertical centre of the hourglass, which is where the top of the sand is,  and the bottom of the sand is <m>0.1</m> metres from 0.
</p>

<p>To find the volume of this solid, we slice it into horizontal disks. The disk that is <m>x</m> metres from the centre of the hourglass has radius <m>x^2+0.01</m> and thickness <m>\dee{x}</m>, so it has volume <m>\pi(x^2+0.01)^2\,\dee{x}</m>.

<me>
W = \int_{0}^{1/2} \sqrt{1-x^4}\,\dee{x} \quad\text{ J}.</me>
</p>

<p>However, the function <m>F(x)=\sqrt{1-x^4}</m> happens to not have an antiderivative that can be expressed as an elementary function. That means we can't use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part 2 to evaluate this integral (at least, not without knowing a bit more about functions than is prerequisite for this course). Instead, we can use numerical methods, like the midpoint rule or Simpson's rule, to approximate its value.
</p>

<p>It's not immediately clear which rule (Simpson's, midpoint, or trapezoidal) will lead us down the easiest path. For Simpson's rule, we need to know the fourth derivative of <m>F(x)</m>, which is not a simple task. But, we often need fewer intervals for Simpson's rule than for the midpoint or trapezoid rules. In this case, we'll show below that  <m>n = 2</m> intervals  suffice to guarantee a low enough error using the midpoint rule, so Simpson's rule won't let us get away with fewer intervals. Below, we find the approximation using the midpoint rule <mdash/> but there are other ways as well.
</p>

<p>In order to decide how many intervals we should use with the midpoint rule, we need to know the second derivative of <m>F(x)</m>.
