<exercise>
<statement><p>
Suppose we have the following functions:
<ul>
<li> <m>y</m> is a differentiable function of <m>x</m>
</li>
<li> <m>f</m> is a function of <m>x</m>, with <m>\int f(x)\,\dee{x}=F(x)</m>

<li> <m>g</m> is a nonzero function of <m>y</m>, with <m>\int \frac{1}{g(y)} \,\dee{y}=G(y)=G(y(x))</m>.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>In the work below, we set up a solution to the separable differential equation
<me>
\diff{y}{x}=f(x)g(y)=f(x)g(y(x)))
</me>
without using the mnemonic of Equation<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_SDEbasicSln"/>.
</p>

<p>By deleting some portion of our work, we can create the solution as it would look using the mnemonic. What portion can be deleted?
</p>

<p>Remark: the purpose of this exercise is to illuminate what, exactly, the mnemonic is a shortcut for. Despite its peculiar look, it agrees with what we already know about integration.

<blockquote>
<textblue>

<md>
<mrow>
\diff{y}{x}&amp;=f(x)g(y(x))
</mrow>
<intertext>Since <m>g(y(x))</m> is a nonzero function, we can divide both sides by it.</intertext><mrow>
\frac{1}{g(y(x))}\cdot\diff{y}{x}&amp;=f(x)
</mrow>
<intertext>If these functions of <m>x</m> are the same, then they have the same antiderivative with respect to <m>x</m>.</intertext><mrow>
\int \frac{1}{g(y(x))}\cdot\diff{y}{x}\,\dee{x}&amp;=\int f(x)\,\dee{x}
</mrow>
<intertext>The left integral is in the correct form for a change of variables to <m>y</m>. To make this easier to see, we'll use a <m>u</m>-substitution, since it's a little more familiar than a <m>y</m>-substitution. If <m>u=y</m>, then <m>\diff{u}{x}=\diff{y}{x}</m>, so <m>\dee{u}=\diff{y}{x}\dee{x}</m>.

</statement>
<hint><p>
The step <m>\displaystyle\int \frac{1}{g(y)}\,\dee{y} = \int f(x)\,\dee{x}</m> shows up whether we're using our mnemonic or not.
</p></hint>
<answer><p>
The mnemonic allows us to skip from the separable differential equation we want to solve (very first line) to the equation
<me>
\int \frac{1}{g(y)}\,\dee{y}=\int f(x)\,\dee{x}</me>

</answer>
<solution><p>
The mnemonic allows us to skip from the separable differential equation we want to solve (very first line) to the equation
<me>
\int \frac{1}{g(y)}\,\dee{y}=\int f(x)\,\dee{x}</me>

<p>So, the mnemonic is just a shortcut for the substitution we performed to get this point.

<p>We also generally skip the explanation about <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> being replaced with <m>C</m>.

false
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
To say <m>y=f(x)+C</m> is a solution to the differential equation means:
<md>
<mrow>
\diff{}{x}\{f(x)+C\}&amp;=x(f(x)+C)
</mrow>
<intertext>Since <m>y=f(x)</m> is a solution, we know <m>\diff{}{x}\{f(x)\}=xf(x)</m>. Also, <m>\diff{}{x}\{f(x)+C\}=\diff{}{x}\{f(x)\}</m>. So, <m>\diff{}{x}\{f(x)+C\}=xf(x)</m>.

<mrow>
xf(x)&amp;=x(f(x)+C)

0&amp;=xC

</md>
Our equation should hold for all <m>x</m> in our domain, and for the derivative to <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m> to make sense, our domain should not be a single point. So, there is some <m>x</m> in our domain such that <m>x \neq 0</m>. Therefore, the  <m>C</m> <em>must be zero</em>. So, <m>f(x)+C</m> is <em>not</em> a solution to the differential equation for any constant <m>C</m>.
</p>

<p>When we're finding a general antiderivative, we add <q><m>+C</m></q> at the end. When we're finding a general solution to a differential equation, the <q><m>+C</m></q> gets added when we antidifferentiate--we don't add another one at the end of our work.

Suppose a function <m>y=f(x)</m> satisfies <m>|y| = Cx</m>, for some constant <m>C \gt 0</m>.

<hint><p>
If a function is differentiable at a point, it is also continuous at that point.
</p></hint>
<answer><p>
(a) <m>[0,\infty)</m>
</p><p>
(b) No such function exists. If <m>|f(x)|=Cx</m> and <m>f(x)</m> switches from <m>f(x)=Cx</m> to <m>f(x)=-Cx</m> at some point, then that point is a jump discontinuity. Where <m>f(x)</m> contains a discontinuity, <m>\diff{y}{x}</m> does not exist.
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
<ol label="a">
<li> Since <m>|y| \geq 0</m> no matter what <m>y</m> is, we see <m>Cx \ge 0</m> for all <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f(x)</m>. Since <m>C</m> is positive, that means the domain of <m>f(x)</m> only includes nonnegative numbers. So, the largest possible domain of <m>f(x)</m> is <m>[0,\infty)</m>.
</li>
<li>
<p>
None exists.
</p>

<p>The graph of <m>Cx</m> is given below for some positive constant <m>C</m>, also with the graph of <m>-Cx</m>. If <m>y=f(x)</m> were sometimes the top function, and other times the bottom function, then there would be a jump discontinuity where it switched. Then the derivative of <m>f(x)</m> would not exist, violating the second property.
</p><sidebyside width="50%">

\draw[very thick, red] (0,0)--(3,-2) node[right]{$y=-Cx$};

</sidebyside>
<p>A tiny technical note is that it's possible that <m>f(x)=Cx</m> when <m>x=0</m> and <m>f(x)=-Cx</m> when <m>x \gt 0</m> (or vice-versa). This would not introduce a jump discontinuity, but it also does not satisfy that <m>f(x) \gt 0</m> for some values of <m>x</m>.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
Remark: in several instances below, solving a differential equation will lead us to conclude something like <m>|y|=g(x)</m>. In these cases, we choose either <m>y=g(x)</m>, or <m>y=-g(x)</m>, but not <m>y=\pm g(x)</m> (which is not a function) or that <m>y</m> is sometimes <m>g(x)</m>, and other times <m>-g(x)</m>. The reasoning above somewhat explains this choice: if <m>y</m> were sometimes positive and sometimes negative, then <m>\diff{y}{x}</m> would not exist at the values of <m>x</m> where the sign of <m>y</m> switches, unless that switch occurrs at a root of <m>g(x)</m>. Since that's a pretty specific occurrence, we usually feel safe ignoring it to avoid getting bogged down in technical details.

</p>

<blockquote>
<textblue>
<p>About 0.3 percent of the total quantity of morphine in the bloodstream is eliminated every minute.
</p>
</textblue>
</blockquote>
</statement>
<hint><p>
Let <m>Q(t)</m> be the quantity of morphine in a patient's bloodstream at time <m>t</m>, where <m>t</m> is measured in minutes.
</p>

<p>Using the definition of a derivative,
<me>
\diff{Q}{t}=\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{Q(t+h)-Q(t)}{h}\approx \frac{Q(t+1)-Q(t)}{1}</me>
</p>

<p>So, <m>\diff{Q}{t}</m> is roughly the change in the amount of morphine in one minute, from <m>t</m> to <m>t+1</m>.
</p></hint>

<m>\displaystyle \diff{Q}{t}=-0.003Q(t)</m>

<solution><p>
Let <m>Q(t)</m> be the quantity of morphine in a patient's bloodstream at time <m>t</m>, where <m>t</m> is measured in minutes.

<me>

<p>The sentence tells us that the change in the amount of morphine in one minute is about <m>-0.003Q</m>, where <m>Q</m> is the quantity in the bloodstream. That is:
<me>

<exercise purpose="RQS">
<statement><p>
Suppose a particular change is occurring in a language, from an old form to a new form.
<fn>
An example is the change in German from <q>wollt</q> to <q>wollst</q> for the second-person conjugation of the verb <q>wollen.</q> This example is provided by the site Laws in Quantitative Linguistics, <url href="http://lql.uni-trier.de/index.php/Change_in_language">Change in Language</url>, accessed 18 August 2017.</fn>
 Let <m>p(t)</m> be the proportion (measured as a number between 0, meaning none, and 1, meaning all) of the time that speakers use the new form. Piotrowski's law
<fn>Piotrowski's law is paraphrased from the page <url href="http://www.glottopedia.org/index.php/Piotrowski-Gesetz" >Piotrowski-Gesetz</url> on Glottopedia, accessed 18 August 2017. According to this source, the law was based on work by the married couple R. G. Piotrowski and A. A. Piotrowskaja, later generalized by G. Altmann.
</fn> predicts the following.
</p>

<blockquote>
<textblue>
<p>
Use of the new form over time spreads at a rate that is proportional to the product of the proportion of the new form and the proportion of the old form.
</p>
</textblue>
</blockquote>

<p>Express this as a differential equation. You do not need to solve the differential equation.
</p></statement>
<hint><p>
If <m>p(t)</m> is the proportion of the new form, then <m>1-p(t)</m> is the proportion of the old form.
</p>

<p>When we say two quantities are proportional, we mean that one is a constant multiple of the other.
</p></hint>
<answer><p>
<m>\diff{p}{t}=\alpha p(t)\big(1-p(t)\big)</m>, for some constant <m>\alpha</m>.
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
If <m>p(t)</m> is the proportion of times speakers use the new form, measured between 0 and 1, then <m>1-p(t)</m> is the proportion of times speakers use the old form.
</p>

<p>The law, then, states that <m>\diff{p}{t}</m> is proportional to <m>p(t)\times \big(1-p(t)\big)</m>. When we say two quantities are proportional, we mean that one is a constant multiple of the other. So, the law says
<me>
\diff{p}{t}=\alpha p(t)\big(1-p(t)\big)</me>
</p>

<p>for some constant <m>\alpha</m>.
</p>

<p>Remark: it follows from this model that, when a new form is either very rare or entirely ubiquitous, the rate of change of its adoption is small. This makes sense: if the new form is used all the time (<m>p(t)\approx 1</m>), there's nobody left to convert; if the new form is almost never used (<m>p(t)\approx 0</m>) then people don't know about it, so they won't pick it up.

The small red lines have varying slopes. The red lines on points with <m>y</m>-coordinate 2 have slopes of  <m>0</m>; this matches <m>y'</m> when <m>y=0</m>, as we saw above.
The red lines on points with <m>y</m>-coordinate 0 have slopes of approximately <m>-1</m>;
again, this matches what we found for <m>y'</m> when <m>y=0</m>.

<p>The red lines correspond to a tiny section of <m>y(x)</m>, <em>if</em> <m>y(x)</m> passes through that point. So, we can sketch a possible curve <m>y(x)</m> satisfying the equation by starting somewhere, then following the slopes.

There are <m>7 \times 7 = 49</m> points on the grid; we don't want to make 49 separate calculations. Let's find some shortcuts.
<ul>
<li> If <m>y'(x)=0</m>, then <m>y=\frac{x}{2}</m>, which applies to the points <m>(0,0)</m>, <m>(2,1)</m>, <m>(4,2)</m> and <m>(6,3)</m>. These are the orange dots in the sketch below.
</li>
<li> If <m>y'(x)=1</m>, then <m>y=1+\frac{x}{2}</m>, which applies to the points <m>(0,1)</m>, <m>(2,2)</m>, and <m>(4,3)</m>. (Note these are exactly 1 unit above the points with <m>y'=0</m>.)
These are the red dots in the sketch below.
</li>
<li> If <m>y'(x)=-1</m>, then <m>y=-1+\frac{x}{2}</m>, which applies to the points <m>(0,-1)</m>, <m>(2,-2)</m>, and <m>(4,-3)</m>. (Note these are exactly 1 unit below the points with <m>y'=0</m>.)
These are the yellow dots in the sketch below.
</li>
<li> If <m>x</m> increases and <m>y</m> stays the same, <m>y</m> decreases.
</li>
<li> If <m>y</m> increases and <m>x</m> stays the same, <m>y</m> increases.
</li>
<li> If we draw a straight line of slope <m>\dfrac{1}{2}</m> on our sketch, for every point on that line, our mark has the same slope: for instance, the points where we draw a mark with slope 0 are <m>(0,0)</m>, <m>(2,1)</m>, and <m>(4,2)</m>, and these all lie on the line <m>f(x)=\frac{x}{2}</m>.
</li>
</ul>
This is enough to give us a pretty good sketch. The points whose slopes we found explicitly have dots; the rest can be sketched as either steeper or less steep than what's near them.

It's important to note that <m>y=\pm3\sqrt{1+x^2}</m> is not a function: for an equation to represent a function, for every input in the domain, there must only be one output. That is, functions pass the vertical line test. (See the CLP-1 text for a definition of the vertical line test and a formal definition of a function.) So, we need to decide whether our function is <m>y=3\sqrt{1+x^2}</m> or <m>y=-3\sqrt{1+x^2}</m>. Since <m>y(0)=3</m>, we conclude

<m>B(t)=0</m> obeys the differential equation so that <m>C=0</m> is allowed, even
though it is not of the form <m>C=e^{C'}</m>. This seeming discrepancy arose because, in our very first step of part (a), we divided both sides of the differential equation by <m>B</m>, which is only allowable if <m>B\neq 0</m>. So, in this step, we implicitly assumed <m>B</m> was nonzero.

<statement><p>
An endowment is an investment account in which the balance ideally
remains constant and withdrawals are made on the interest earned
by the account. Such an account may be modeled by the initial value
problem <m>B'(t) = aB - m</m> for <m>t \ge 0</m>, with <m>B(0) = B_0</m> . The
constant <m>a</m> reflects the annual interest rate, <m>m</m> is the annual
rate of withdrawal, and <m>B_0</m> is the initial balance in the account.
</p>

<p><ol label="a">
<li>
Solve the initial value problem with <m>a = 0.02</m> and <m>B(0) = B_0 = \$30,000</m>.
Note that your answer depends on the constant <m>m</m>.

Again, you do not need to know anything about investing

The given differential equation is separable and we could solve it
accordingly. In fact we have already done so. If we rewrite the equation in the
form
<md>
<mrow>
\diff{B}{t} = a\Big(B-\frac{m}{a}\Big)

</md>
it is of the form covered by Theorem <xref ref="thm_linearODE"/>. So that theorem tells us that the solution is
<md>
<mrow>
B(t) = \left(B(0)-\frac{m}{a}\right) e^{at} + \frac{m}{a}

</md>
In this problem we are told that <m>a=0.02=\frac{1}{50}</m>, so

B(t) = \left\{B(0)-50m\right\} e^{t/50} + 50m

The solution of part (a) is independent of time if and only if

What we're given is an equation relating <m>y</m> to the integral of a function of <m>y</m>. What we know how to solve is an equation relating the <em>derivative</em> of <m>y</m> to a function of <m>y</m>. We can create this by differentiating the given integral equation.

A cylindrical water tank, of radius 3 meters and height 6 meters,

meters) and
</li>
<li>
<m>v(t)</m> is the velocity of the escaping water  at time <m>t</m> (in

<hint><p>
Suppose that in a very short time interval <m>\dee{t}</m>, the height

Express in two different ways the volume of water that has escaped

<solution><p>
Suppose that in a very short time interval <m>\dee{t}</m>, the height
of water in the tank changes by <m>\dee{h}</m> (which is negative).
Then in this time interval the amount of the water in the tank decreases
by <m>\dee{V}=-\pi(3)^2\dee{h}</m>.
This must be the same as the amount of water that flows through the hole
in this time interval. The water flowing through the hole makes a cylinder of radius 1 cm (that is, 0.01 m) with length <m>v(t)\dee{t}</m>, the distance the water moves out of the hole in <m>\dee{t}</m> seconds. So, the amount of water leaving the hole over the time interval <m>\dee{t}</m> is  <m>\pi(0.01)^2 v(t)\,\dee{t}

<statement><p>
A spherical tank of radius 6 feet is full of mercury when
a circular hole of radius 1 inch is opened in the bottom. How long will
it take for all of the mercury to drain from the tank?
</p>

<p> Use the value
<m>g=32\ {\rm feet}/{\rm sec}^2</m>.
Also use Torricelli's law, which states when the height of mercury in the tank
is <m>h</m>, the speed of the mercury escaping from the tank is <m>v=\sqrt{2gh}</m>.
</p></statement>

<hint><p>
Sketch the mercury in the tank at time <m>t</m>,  when it has height <m>h</m>,
and also at time <m>t+\dee{t}</m>, when it has height <m>h+\dee{h}</m> (with <m>\dee{h} \lt 0</m>).
The difference between those two volumes is the volume of (essentially)
a disk of thickness <m>-\dee{h}</m>. Figure out the radius and then the volume
of that disk. This volume has to be the same as the volume of mercury that
left through the hole in the bottom of the sphere, which runs out in the shape of a cylinder. Toricelli's law tells
you what the length of that cylinder is, and from there you can find its volume. Setting the two volumes equal to each other gives
the differential equation that determines <m>h(t)</m>.
</p></hint>

<answer><p>
<m>\displaystyle t=\frac{4\times 144}{15} \sqrt{\frac{12^5}{2g}}
   \approx 2,394\,\text{sec }\approx 0.665\, \text{hr}</m>
</p></answer>

<solution><p>
Suppose that at time <m>t</m>, the mercury in the tank has height <m>h</m>, which is
between 0 and 12 feet.
</p>

<sidebyside width="33%">
<image source="problems/figs/OE00D_4"/>

<p>
At that time, the top surface of the mercury
forms a circular disk of radius <m>\sqrt{6^2-(h-6)^2}</m>. (We found this by applying the Pythagorean Theorem to the triangle in the diagram above. In the diagram, <m>h</m> is shown as being larger than 6, but the same equation holds for all <m>h</m> in <m>[0,12]</m>.)
Now suppose that in a very short time interval <m>\dee{t}</m>, the height
of mercury in the tank changes by <m>\dee{h}</m> (which is negative). Then in this
time interval the amount of the mercury in the tank decreases by
<m>-\pi\big(\sqrt{6^2-(h-6)^2}\ \big)^2\dee{h}</m>. (That's the volume of the
red disk in the figure above.) This must be the same as the amount of mercury
that flows through the hole in this time interval. The  mercury comes out of the hole as a cylinder. Its radius is the radius of the hole, <m>\frac{1}{12}</m> foot, and its length is the distance the mercury travels in <m>\dee{t}</m> seconds, <m>v(t)\dee{t}</m> feet. So, the volume of escaped mercury is
 <m>\pi\big(\frac{1}{12}\big)^2 v\,\dee{t}
=\pi\big(\frac{1}{12}\big)^2 \sqrt{2gh}\,\dee{t}</m>.
This gives us a separable differential equation.

<statement><p>
A tank 2 m tall is to be made with circular cross--sections
with radius <m>r=y^p</m>. Here <m>y</m> measures the vertical distance from
the bottom of the tank and <m>p</m> is a positive constant to be
determined. You may assume that when the tank drains, it obeys
Torricelli's law, that is
<md>
<mrow>
A(y)\diff{y}{t}=-c\sqrt{y}
</mrow>
</md>
for some constant <m>c</m> where <m>A(y)</m> is the cross--sectional area of the
tank at height <m>y</m>. It is desired that the tank be constructed so
that the top half
(<m>y=2</m> to <m>y=1</m>) takes exactly the same amount of time to drain as the
bottom half (<m>y=1</m> to <m>y=0</m>). Determine the value of <m>p</m> so that the tank
has this property. <em>Note:</em> it is not possible or necessary to find
<m>c</m> for this question.
</p>
</statement>

<hint><p>
For any <m>p \gt 0</m>, determine first <m>y(t)</m> (in terms of <m>p</m> and <m>c</m>) and then the times (also depending on <m>p</m> and <m>c</m>) at which
<m>y=2</m>, <m>y=1</m> and <m>y=0</m>. The condition that <q>the top half
takes exactly the same amount of time to drain as the
bottom half</q> then gives an equation that determines <m>p</m>.
</p></hint>

<m>p=\frac{1}{4}</m>
</p></answer>

<solution><p>
Suppose that at time <m>t</m> (measured in hours starting at, say, noon),
the water in the tank has height <m>y</m>, which is
between 0 and 2 metres. At that time, the top surface of the water
forms a circular disk of radius <m>r=y^p</m> and area <m>A(y)=\pi y^{2p}</m>.
Thus, by Torricelli's law,
