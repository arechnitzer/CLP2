<title>Partial Fractions</title>
<introduction>

<p>
Partial fractions is the name given to a technique of integration that may be used to integrate any rational function
	<fn>
		Recall that a rational  function is the ratio of two polynomials.
	</fn>.
We already know how to integrate some simple  rational
functions
<md>
<mrow>
  \int \frac{1}{x}\dee{x} &amp;= \log|x|+C &amp;
  \int \frac{1}{1+x^2} \dee{x} &amp;= \arctan(x) +C
</mrow>
</md>
Combining these with the substitution rule, we can integrate similar but more complicated  rational functions:
<md>
<mrow>
  \int \frac{1}{2x+3}\dee{x} &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \log|2x+3| +C &amp;
  \int \frac{1}{3+4x^2}\dee{x} &amp;= \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}} \arctan\left( \frac{2x}{\sqrt{3}}
\right) +C
</mrow>
</md>
By summing such terms together we can integrate yet more complicated forms
<md>
<mrow>
  \int \left[ x + \frac{1}{x+1} + \frac{1}{x-1} \right]\dee{x}
  &amp;= \frac{x^2}{2} + \log|x+1| + \log|x-1| +C
</mrow>
</md>
However we are not (typically) presented with a rational function nicely decomposed into  neat little pieces. It is far more likely that the rational function will be written as  the ratio of two polynomials. For example:
<md>
<mrow>
  \int \frac{x^3+x}{x^2-1}\dee{x}
</mrow>
</md>
In this specific example it is not hard to confirm that
<md>
<mrow>
x+\frac{1}{x+1} +\frac{1}{x-1}
&amp;=\frac{x(x+1)(x-1) +(x-1) +(x+1)}{(x+1)(x-1)}
=\frac{x^3+x}{x^2-1}
</mrow>
</md>
and hence
<md>
<mrow>
  \int \frac{x^3+x}{x^2-1}\dee{x}
&amp;= \int \left[ x + \frac{1}{x+1} + \frac{1}{x-1} \right]\dee{x}
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;= \frac{x^2}{2} + \log|x+1| + \log|x-1| +C
</mrow>
</md>
Of course going in this direction (from a sum of terms to a single rational function) is  straightforward. To be useful we need to understand how to do this in reverse:  decompose a given rational function into a sum of simpler pieces that we can integrate.
</p>

<p>
Suppose that <m>N(x)</m> and <m>D(x)</m> are polynomials. The basic strategy is to write  <m>\frac{N(x)}{D(x)}</m> as a sum of very simple, easy to integrate rational functions, namely
<ol label="1">
<li>
	polynomials <mdash/> we shall see below that these are needed when the degree
	<fn>
		The degree of a polynomial is the largest power of <m>x</m>. For example, the  degree of <m>2x^3+4x^2+6x+8</m> is three.
	</fn>
of <m>N(x)</m> is equal to or strictly bigger than the degree of  <m>D(x)</m>,  and
</li>
<li>
	rational functions of the particularly simple form <m>\frac{A}{(ax+b)^n}</m> and
</li>
<li>
	rational functions of the form <m>\frac{Ax+B}{(ax^2+bx+c)^m}</m>.
</li>
</ol>
We already know how to integrate the first two forms, and we'll see how to integrate the  third form in the near future.
</p>

<p>
To begin to explore this method of decomposition, let us go back to the example we just  saw
<md>
<mrow>
x+\frac{1}{x+1} +\frac{1}{x-1}
&amp;=\frac{x(x+1)(x-1) +(x-1) +(x+1)}{(x+1)(x-1)}
=\frac{x^3+x}{x^2-1}
</mrow>
</md>
The technique that we will use is based on two observations:
<ol label="1">
<li>
	The denominators on the left-hand side of are the factors of the denominator  <m>x^2-1=(x-1)(x+1)</m> on the right-hand side.
</li>
<li>
<p>
	Use <m>P(x)</m> to denote the polynomial on the left hand side, and then use <m>N(x)</m> and  <m>D(x)</m> to denote the numerator and denominator of the right hand side. That is
	<md>
	<mrow>
	  P(x)&amp;=x &amp; N(x)&amp;= x^3+x &amp; D(x)&amp;= x^2-1.
	</mrow>
	</md>
	Then the degree of <m>N(x)</m> is the sum of the degrees of <m>P(x)</m> and <m>D(x)</m>. This is because  the highest degree term in <m>N(x)</m> is <m>x^3</m>, which comes from multiplying <m>P(x)</m> by <m>D(x)</m>,  as we see in
	<md>
	<mrow>
		x + \frac{1}{x+1} + \frac{1}{x-1}
	  &amp;=\frac{   \overbrace{x}^{P(x)}
			  \overbrace{(x+1)(x-1)}^{D(x)}
			  + (x-1) + (x+1)  }
			  {(x+1)(x-1)}
		=\frac{x^3+x}{x^2-1}
	</mrow>
	</md>
</p>

<p>
	More generally, the presence of a polynomial on the left hand side is signalled on the right hand side by the fact that the degree of the numerator is at least as large as the degree of the denominator.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</p>
</introduction>

<subsection><title>Partial fraction decomposition examples</title>

<p>
Rather than writing up the technique <mdash/> known as the partial fraction decomposition <mdash/>  in full generality, we will instead illustrate it through a sequence of examples.
</p>

<example xml:id="eg_PFa"><title><m>\int\frac{x-3}{x^2-3x+2}\dee{x}</m></title>
<p>
	In this example, we integrate <m>\frac{N(x)}{D(x)}=\frac{x-3}{x^2-3x+2}</m>.
</p>

<p>
<alert>Solution:</alert>
<ul>
<li>
	<em>Step 1.</em> We first check to see if a polynomial <m>P(x)</m> is needed. To do so,  we check to see if the degree of the numerator, <m>N(x)</m>, is strictly smaller than the  degree of the denominator <m>D(x)</m>.  In this example, the numerator, <m>x-3</m>, has degree one  and that is indeed strictly smaller than the degree of the denominator, <m>x^2-3x+2</m>, which  is two. In this case
		<fn>
			We will soon get to an example (Example<nbsp/><xref ref="eg_PFb"/> in  fact) in which the numerator degree is at least as large as the denominator degree <mdash/> in   that situation we have to extract a polynomial <m>P(x)</m> before we can move on to step 2.
		</fn>
	we  do not need to extract a polynomial <m>P(x)</m> and we move on to step 2.
</li>
<li>
	<em>Step 2.</em>  The second step is to factor the denominator
	<md>
	<mrow>
	x^2-3x+2&amp;=(x-1)(x-2)
	</mrow>
	</md>
	In this example it is quite easy, but in future examples (and quite possibly in your  homework, quizzes and exam) you will have to work harder to factor the denominator. In  Appendix<nbsp/><xref ref="ap_roots"/> we have written up some simple tricks for factoring polynomials. We will illustrate them in Example<nbsp/><xref ref="eg_PFc"/> below.
</li>
<li>
<p>
	<em>Step 3.</em>  The third step is to write <m>\frac{x-3}{x^2-3x+2}</m> in the form
	<md>
	<mrow>
	\frac{x-3}{x^2-3x+2} =\frac{A}{x-1}+\frac{B}{x-2}
	</mrow>
	</md>
	for some constants <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. More generally, if the denominator consists of <m>n</m>  different linear factors, then we decompose the ratio as
	<md>
	<mrow>
	  \text{rational function} &amp;=
	  \frac{A_1}{\text{linear factor 1}} +
	  \frac{A_2}{\text{linear factor 2}} + \cdots +
	  \frac{A_n}{\text{linear factor n}}
	</mrow>
	</md>
	</p>

	<p>To proceed we need to determine the values of the constants <m>A,\ B</m> and there are several  different methods to do so.  Here are two methods
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	<em>Step 3 <mdash/> Algebra Method.</em> This approach has the benefit of being  conceptually clearer and easier, but the downside is that it is more tedious.
</p>

<p>
	To determine the values of the constants <m>A,\ B</m>, we put
		<fn>
			That is, we take the decomposed form and sum it back together.
		</fn>
	the right-hand side back over the common denominator <m>(x-1)(x-2)</m>.
	<md>
	<mrow>
	\frac{x-3}{x^2-3x+2}
	=\frac{A}{x-1}+\frac{B}{x-2}
	=\frac{A(x-2)+B(x-1)}{(x-1)(x-2)}
	</mrow>
	</md>
	The fraction on the far left is the same as the fraction on the far right if and only if their numerators are the same.
	<md>
	<mrow>
	x-3&amp;=A(x-2)+B(x-1)
	</mrow>
	<intertext>
		Write the right hand side as a polynomial in standard  form (i.e. collect up all <m>x</m> terms and all constant terms)
	</intertext>
	<mrow>
	x-3&amp;=(A+B)x +(-2A-B)
	</mrow>
	</md>
	For these two polynomials to be the same, the coefficient of <m>x</m> on the left hand side and the coefficient of <m>x</m> on the right hand side must be the same. Similarly the coefficients of <m>x^0</m> (i.e. the constant terms) must match. This gives us a system of two equations.
	<md>
	<mrow>
	A+B&amp;=1 &amp; -2A-B&amp;=-3
	</mrow>
	</md>
	in the two unknowns <m>A,B</m>. We can solve this system by
	<ul>
	<li>
		using the first equation, namely <m>A+B=1</m>, to determine <m>A</m>  in terms of <m>B</m>:
		<md>
		<mrow>
		A=1-B
		</mrow>
		</md>
	</li>
	<li>
		Substituting this into the remaining equation eliminates the <m>A</m> from second equation, leaving one equation in the one unknown <m>B</m>, which can then be solved for <m>B</m>:
		<md>
		<mrow>
		  -2A-B&amp;=-3 &amp; \text{substitute $A=1-B$}
		</mrow><mrow>
		  -2(1-B)-B&amp;=-3 &amp; \text{clean up}
		</mrow><mrow>
		  -2+B &amp;=-3 &amp; \text{so $B=-1$}
		</mrow>
		</md>
	</li>
	<li>
		Once we know <m>B</m>, we can substitute it back into <m>A=1-B</m> to get <m>A</m>.
		<md>
		<mrow>
		A=1-B=1-(-1)=2
		</mrow>
		</md>
	</li>
	</ul>
	Hence
	<md>
	<mrow>
	  \frac{x-3}{x^2-3x+2}
	=\frac{2}{x-1}-\frac{1}{x-2}
	</mrow>
	</md>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	<em>Step 3 <mdash/> Sneaky Method.</em> This takes a little more work to understand,  but it is more efficient than the algebra method.
</p>

<p>
	We wish to find <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> for which
	<md>
	<mrow>
	\frac{x-3}{(x-1)(x-2)}
	=\frac{A}{x-1}+\frac{B}{x-2}
	</mrow>
	</md>
	Note that the denominator on the left hand side has been written in factored form.
	<ul>
	<li>
		To determine <m>A</m>, we multiply both sides of the equation by <m>A</m>'s denominator, which is <m>x-1</m>,
		<md>
		<mrow>
		\frac{x-3}{x-2}
		=A+\frac{(x-1)B}{x-2}
		</mrow>
		</md>
		and then we completely eliminate <m>B</m> from the equation by evaluating at <m>x=1</m>. This value of <m>x</m> is chosen to make <m>x-1=0</m>.
		<md>
		<mrow>
		\frac{x-3}{x-2}\bigg|_{x=1}
		=A+\frac{(x-1)B}{x-2}\bigg|_{x=1}
		\implies A = \frac{1-3}{1-2} = 2
		</mrow>
		</md>
	</li>
	<li>
		To determine <m>B</m>, we multiply both sides of the equation by <m>B</m>'s denominator, which is <m>x-2</m>,
		<md>
		<mrow>
		\frac{x-3}{x-1}
		=\frac{(x-2)A}{x-1} + B
		</mrow>
		</md>
		and then we completely eliminate <m>A</m> from the equation by evaluating at <m>x=2</m>. This value of <m>x</m> is chosen to make <m>x-2=0</m>.
		<md>
		<mrow>
		\frac{x-3}{x-1}\bigg|_{x=2}
		=\frac{(x-2)A}{x-1}\bigg|_{x=2} +B
		\implies B = \frac{2-3}{2-1} = -1
		</mrow>
		</md>
	</li>
	</ul>
	Hence we have (the thankfully consistent answer)
	<md>
	<mrow>
	\frac{x-3}{x^2-3x+2} =\frac{2}{x-1}-\frac{1}{x-2}
	</mrow>
	</md>
	Notice that no matter which method we use to find the constants we can easily check our  answer by summing the terms back together:
	<md>
	<mrow>
	  \frac{2}{x-1}-\frac{1}{x-2}
	&amp;= \frac{2(x-2)-(x-1)}{(x-2)(x-1)}
	</mrow>
	<mrow>
	&amp; = \frac{2x-4-x+1}{x^2-3x+2}
	= \frac{x-3}{x^2-3x+2} \checkmark
	</mrow>
	</md>
</p>
</li>

<li>
	<em>Step 4.</em>
	 The final step is to integrate.
	<md>
	<mrow>
	\int\frac{x-3}{x^2-3x+2}\dee{x}
	&amp; =\int \frac{2}{x-1}\dee{x} +\int \frac{-1}{x-2}\dee{x}
	</mrow>
	<mrow>
	&amp; =2\log|x-1|-\log|x-2|+C
	</mrow>
	</md>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
</example>

<p>
	Perhaps the first thing that you notice is that this process takes quite a few steps
	<fn>
		Though, in fairness, we did step 3 twice <mdash/> and that is the most  tedious bit<ellipsis/> Actually <mdash/> sometimes factoring the denominator can be quite  challenging. We'll consider this issue in more detail shortly.
	</fn>.
However no single step  is all that complicated; it only takes practice. With that said, let's do another,  slightly more complicated, one.
</p>

<example xml:id="eg_PFb"><title><m>\int\frac{3x^3-8x^2+4x-1}{x^2-3x+2}\dee{x}</m></title>
<p>
In this example, we integrate <m>\frac{N(x)}{D(x)} =\frac{3x^3-8x^2+4x-1}{x^2-3x+2}</m>.
</p>

<p><alert>Solution:</alert>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
	<em>Step 1.</em>  We first check to see if the degree of the numerator <m>N(x)</m> is  strictly smaller than the degree of the denominator <m>D(x)</m>. In this  example, the numerator, <m>3x^3-8x^2+4x-1</m>, has degree three and the  denominator, <m>x^2-3x+2</m>, has degree two. As <m>3\ge 2</m>, we have to implement the first step.
</p>

<p>
	The goal of the first step is to write <m>\frac{N(x)}{D(x)}</m>  in the form
	<md>
	<mrow>
	\frac{N(x)}{D(x)}=P(x)+\frac{R(x)}{D(x)}
	</mrow>
	</md>
	with <m>P(x)</m> being a polynomial and <m>R(x)</m> being a polynomial of degree strictly smaller than the degree of <m>D(x)</m>. The right hand side is <m>\frac{P(x)D(x)+R(x)}{D(x)}</m>, so we have to express the numerator in the form <m>N(x)=P(x)D(x)+R(x)</m>, with <m>P(x)</m> and <m>R(x)</m> being polynomials and with the degree of <m>R</m> being strictly smaller than the degree of <m>D</m>.  <m>P(x)D(x)</m> is a sum of expressions of the form <m>ax^n D(x)</m>. We want to pull as many expressions of this form as possible out of the numerator <m>N(x)</m>, leaving only a low degree remainder <m>R(x)</m>.
</p>

<p>
	We do this using long division <mdash/> the same long division you learned in school, but with  the base 10 replaced by <m>x</m>.
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
	<li>
	<p>
		We start by observing that to get from the highest degree  term in the denominator (<m>x^2</m>) to the highest degree term in the numerator (<m>3x^3</m>), we  have to multiply it by <m>3x</m>. So we write,
	</p>
	<sidebyside width="50%">
		<image source="text/figs/longdiv2a"/>
	</sidebyside>
	<p>
		In the above expression, the denominator is on the left, the numerator is on the right  and <m>3x</m> is written above the highest order term of the numerator. Always put lower powers of <m>x</m> to the right of higher powers of <m>x</m> <mdash/> this mirrors how you do long  division with numbers; lower powers of ten sit to the right of lower powers of ten.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
		Now we subtract <m>3x</m> times the denominator, <m>x^2-3x+2</m>, which is <m>3x^3-9x^2+6x</m>,  from the numerator.
	</p>

	<sidebyside width="66%">
	<image source="text/figs/longdiv2b"/>
	</sidebyside>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
		This has left a remainder of <m>x^2-2x-1</m>. To get from the highest degree term in the denominator (<m>x^2</m>) to the highest degree term in the remainder (<m>x^2</m>), we have to multiply by <m>1</m>. So we write,
	</p>
	<sidebyside width="50%">
	<image source="text/figs/longdiv2c"/>
	</sidebyside>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
		Now we subtract <m>1</m> times the denominator, <m>x^2-3x+2</m>, which is <m>x^2-3x+2</m>, from the remainder.
	</p>
	<sidebyside width="75%">
	<image source="text/figs/longdiv2d"/>
	</sidebyside>
	</li>
	<li>
		This leaves a remainder of <m>x-3</m>. Because the remainder has degree <m>1</m>,  which is smaller than the degree of the denominator (being degree 2), we  stop.
	</li>
	<li>
		In this example, when we subtracted <m>3x(x^2-3x+2)</m> and  <m>1(x^2-3x+2)</m> from <m>3x^3-8x^2+4x-1</m> we ended up with <m>x-3</m>. That is,
		<md>
		<mrow>
		&amp;3x^3-8x^2+4x-1
		\ -\ 3x(x^2-3x+2)
		\ -\ 1(x^2-3x+2)
		\ =\ x-3
		</mrow>
		</md>
		or, collecting the two terms proportional to <m>(x^2-3x+2)</m>
		<md>
		<mrow>
		3x^3-8x^2+4x-1 \ -\ (3x+1)(x^2-3x+2)
		\ =\ x-3
		</mrow>
		</md>
		Moving the <m>(3x+1)(x^2-3x+2)</m> to the right hand side and dividing the whole equation by <m>x^2-3x+2</m> gives
		<md>
		<mrow>
		\frac{3x^3-8x^2+4x-1}{x^2-3x+2} \ =\ 3x+1\ +\ \frac{x-3}{x^2-3x+2}
		</mrow>
		</md>
		And we can easily check this expression just by summing the two terms on the right-hand  side.
	</li>
	</ul>
	We have written the integrand in the form <m>\frac{N(x)}{D(x)}=P(x)+\frac{R(x)}{D(x)},</m> with the degree of <m>R(x)</m> strictly smaller than the degree of <m>D(x)</m>, which is what we  wanted. Observe  that <m>R(x)</m> is the final remainder of the long division procedure and <m>P(x)</m> is at the top of the long division computation.
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<sidebyside width="90%">
<image source="text/figs/longdiv2ee"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
	This is the end of Step 1. Oof! You should definitely practice this step.
</p>
</li>
<li> <em>Step 2.</em>
	The second step is to factor the denominator
	<md>
	<mrow>
	x^2-3x+2=(x-1)(x-2)
	</mrow>
	</md>
	We already did this in Example <xref ref="eg_PFa"/>.
	</li>
	<li> <em>Step 3.</em>
	The third step is to write <m>\frac{x-3}{x^2-3x+2}</m>
	in the form
	<md>
	<mrow>
	\frac{x-3}{x^2-3x+2}
	=\frac{A}{x-1}+\frac{B}{x-2}
	</mrow>
	</md>
	for some constants <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. We already did this in Example <xref ref="eg_PFa"/>. We found <m>A=2</m> and <m>B=-1</m>.
</li>
<li> <em>Step 4.</em>
	 The final step is to integrate.
	<md>
	<mrow>
	\int\frac{3x^3-8x^2+4x-1}{x^2-3x+2}\dee{x}
	&amp;=\int\big[3x+1\big]\dee{x}
	   + \int \frac{2}{x-1}\dee{x} +\int \frac{-1}{x-2}\dee{x}
	</mrow><mrow>[0.1in]
	&amp;=\frac{3}{2}x^2+x+ 2\log|x-1|-\log|x-2|+C
	</mrow>
	</md>
</li>
</ul>
You can see that the integration step is quite quick <mdash/> almost all the work is in  preparing the integrand.
</p>
</example>


<p>
Here is a very solid example. It is quite long and the steps are involved. However please  persist. No single step is too difficult.
</p>


<example xml:id="eg_PFc"><title><m>\int\frac{x^4+5x^3+16x^2+26x+22}{x^3+3x^2+7x+5}\dee{x}</m></title>
<p>
In this example, we integrate <m>\frac{N(x)}{D(x)}= \frac{x^4+5x^3+16x^2+26x+22}{x^3+3x^2+7x+5}</m>.
</p>

<p><alert>Solution:</alert>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
	<em>Step 1.</em>
	Again, we start by comparing the degrees of the numerator and denominator. In this example, the numerator, <m>x^4+5x^3+16x^2+26x+22</m>, has degree four  and the denominator, <m>x^3+3x^2+7x+5</m>, has degree  three. As <m>4\ge 3</m>, we  must execute the first step, which is to write <m>\frac{N(x)}{D(x)}</m> in the  form
	<md>
	<mrow>
	\frac{N(x)}{D(x)}=P(x)+\frac{R(x)}{D(x)}
	</mrow>
	</md>
	with <m>P(x)</m> being a polynomial and <m>R(x)</m> being a polynomial of degree strictly smaller than the degree of <m>D(x)</m>. This step is accomplished by long division, just as we did in Example <xref ref="eg_PFc"/>. We'll go through  the whole process in detail again.
</p>

<p>
	Actually <mdash/> before you read on ahead, please have a go at the long division. It is  good practice.
</p>

<p>
	<ul>

	<em>Step 2.</em>
	The second step is to factor the denominator <m>D(x)=x^3+3x^2+7x+5</m>. In the <q>real world</q> factorisation of polynomials is often very hard. Fortunately
	<fn>
		One does not typically think of mathematics assignments or exams  as nice kind places<ellipsis/> The polynomials that appear in the <q>real world</q> are not so  forgiving. Nature, red in tooth and claw <mdash/> to quote Tennyson inappropriately  (especially when this author doesn't know any other words from the poem).
	</fn>,
	this is not  the <q>real world</q> and there is a trick available to help us find this factorisation. The  reader should take some time to look at Appendix<nbsp/><xref ref="ap_roots"/> before proceeding.
	<ul>
	<li> The trick exploits the fact that most polynomials that appear in homework
	assignments and on tests have integer coefficients and some integer roots. Any integer
	root of a polynomial that has integer coefficients, like <m>D(x)=x^3+3x^2+7x+5</m>, must
	divide the constant term of the polynomial exactly. Why this is true is
	explained
	<fn>
		Appendix<nbsp/><xref ref="ap_roots"/> contains several simple tricks for factoring  polynomials. We recommend that you have a look at them.
	</fn>
	in Appendix<nbsp/><xref ref="ap_roots"/>.
	</li>
	<li>
		So any integer root of <m>x^3+3x^2+7x+5</m> must divide <m>5</m> exactly. Thus the only  integers which can be roots of <m>D(x)</m> are <m>\pm 1</m> and <m>\pm 5</m>. Of course, not all of  these give roots of the polynomial <mdash/> in fact there is no guarantee that any of them  will be. We have to test each one.
	</li>
	<li>
		To test if <m>+1</m> is a root, we sub <m>x=1</m> into <m>D(x)</m>:
		<md>
		<mrow>
		D(1)=1^3+3(1)^2+7(1)+5=16
		</mrow>
		</md>
		As <m>D(1)\ne 0</m>, <m>1</m> is not a root of <m>D(x)</m>.
	</li>
	<li>
		To test if <m>-1</m> is a root, we sub it into <m>D(x)</m>:
		<md>
		<mrow>
		D(-1)=(-1)^3+3(-1)^2+7(-1)+5=-1+3-7+5=0
		</mrow>
		</md>
		As <m>D(-1)= 0</m>, <m>-1</m> is a root of <m>D(x)</m>. As <m>-1</m> is a root of <m>D(x)</m>,  <m>\big(x-(-1)\big)=(x+1)</m> must factor <m>D(x)</m> exactly. We can factor the <m>(x+1)</m> out of <m>D(x)=x^3+3x^2+7x+5</m> by long division once again.
		</li>

	<li>
		It isn't quite time to stop yet; we should attempt to factor the quadratic  factor, <m>x^2+2x+5</m>. We can use the quadratic formula
		<fn>
			To be precise, the quadratic equation <m>ax^2+bx+c=0</m> has solutions
			<me>
			x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.
			</me>
			The term <m>b^2-4ac</m> is called the discriminant and it tells us about the number of  solutions. If the discriminant is positive then there are two real solutions. When it is  zero, there is a single solution. And if it is negative, there is no real solutions (you  need complex numbers to say more than this).
		</fn>
		to find the roots of <m>x^2+2x+5</m>:
		<md>
		<mrow>
		\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}=\frac{-2\pm\sqrt{4-20}}{2}
		=\frac{-2\pm\sqrt{-16}}{2}
		</mrow>
		</md>
		Since this expression contains the square root of a negative number the equation  <m>x^2+2x+5=0</m> has no real solutions; without the use of complex numbers, <m>x^2+2x+5</m> cannot  be factored.
	</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
<p>
	We have reached the end of step 2. At this point we have
	<md>
	<mrow>
	\frac{x^4+5x^3+16x^2+26x+22}{x^3+3x^2+7x+5}

</li>
<li>
<p>
	<em>Step 3.</em>
	The third step is to write <m>\frac{3x^2+7x+12}{(x+1)(x^2+2x+5)}</m> in the form
	<md>
	<mrow>
	\frac{3x^2+7x+12}{(x+1)(x^2+2x+5)} =\frac{A}{x+1}+\frac{Bx+C}{x^2+2x+5}

	</md>
	for some constants <m>A</m>, <m>B</m> and <m>C</m>.
</p>

<p>
	Note that the numerator, <m>Bx+C</m> of the second term on the right hand side is not  just a constant. It is of degree one,  which is exactly one smaller than the degree  of the denominator, <m>x^2+2x+5</m>. More generally, if the denominator consists of  <m>n</m> different linear factors and <m>m</m> different quadratic factors, then we  decompose the ratio as
	<md>
	<mrow>
	  \text{rational function}

	</mrow>
	</md>
</p>

<p>
	To determine the values of the constants <m>A,\ B,\ C</m>, we put the right hand side back over the common denominator <m>(x+1)(x^2+2x+5)</m>.
	<md>
	<mrow>
	\frac{3x^2+7x+12}{(x+1)(x^2+2x+5)}

	&amp; =\frac{A(x^2+2x+5)+(Bx+C)(x+1)}{(x+1)(x^2+2x+5)}

	<md>
	<mrow>
	3x^2+7x+12=A(x^2+2x+5)+(Bx+C)(x+1)
	</mrow>
	</md>
	Again, as in Example <xref ref="eg_PFa"/>, there are a couple of different ways to determine the values of <m>A</m>, <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> from this equation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	<em>Step 3 <mdash/> Algebra Method.</em>
	The conceptually clearest procedure is to write the right hand side as a polynomial in standard form (i.e. collect up all <m>x^2</m> terms, all <m>x</m> terms and all constant terms)
	<md>
	<mrow>
	3x^2+7x+12=(A+B)x^2+(2A+B+C)x+(5A+C)
	</mrow>
	</md>
	For these two polynomials to be the same, the coefficient of <m>x^2</m> on the left hand side and the coefficient of <m>x^2</m> on the right hand side must be the same. Similarly the coefficients of <m>x^1</m> must match and the  coefficients of <m>x^0</m> must match.
</p>

<p>
	This gives us a system of three equations
	<md>
	<mrow>
	 A+B=3 &amp;&amp; 2A+B+C=7 &amp;&amp; 5A+C=12
	</mrow>
	</md>
	in the three unknowns <m>A,B,C</m>. We can solve this system by
	<ul>
	<li>
		using the first equation, namely <m>A+B=3</m>, to determine <m>A</m> in terms of  <m>B</m>: <m>\ \ A=3-B</m>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Substituting this into the remaining two equations eliminates the <m>A</m>'s from these two equations, leaving two equations in the two unknowns <m>B</m> and <m>C</m>.
		<md>
		<mrow>
		&amp; &amp; A&amp;=3-B\qquad &amp; 2A+B+C&amp;=7\qquad &amp; 5A+C&amp;=12

		</mrow>
		</md>
	</li>
	<li>
	Now we can use the equation <m>-B+C=1</m>, to determine <m>B</m> in terms of <m>C</m>:
	<m>B=C-1</m>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Substituting this into the remaining equation eliminates the <m>B</m>'s leaving an equation in the one unknown <m>C</m>, which is easy to solve.

		&amp; &amp; B&amp;=C-1\qquad &amp; -5B+C&amp;=-3

		</md>
	</li>
	<li>
		So <m>C=2</m>, and then <m>B=C-1=1</m>, and then <m>A=3-B=2</m>. Hence
		<md>

	<ul>
	<li>
		In particular, it must be true for <m>x=-1</m>. When <m>x=-1</m>, the factor <m>(x+1)</m>  multiplying <m>Bx+C</m> is exactly zero. So <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> disappear from the equation, leaving us with an easy equation to solve for <m>A</m>:

	<li>
		Sub this value of <m>A</m> back in and simplify.

	<li>
		We test to see if <m>\pm 1</m> are roots.

	   </md>
	   We now know that both <m>-1</m> and <m>-2</m> are roots of <m>x^3 + 5x^2 + 8x + 4</m> and hence both  <m>(x+1)</m> and <m>(x+2)</m> are factors of  <m>x^3 + 5x^2 + 8x + 4</m>. Because <m>x^3 + 5x^2 + 8x + 4</m>  is of degree three and the coefficient of <m>x^3</m> is <m>1</m>, we must have <m>x^3 + 5x^2 + 8x + 4  = (x+1)(x+2)(x+a)</m> for some constant <m>a</m>. Multiplying out the right hand side shows that  the constant term is <m>2a</m>. So <m>2a=4</m> and <m>a=2</m>.
   </li>

   This is the end of step 2. We now know that

	As in the previous examples, there are a couple of different ways  to determine the values of <m>A</m>, <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> from this equation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	<em>Step 3 <mdash/> Algebra Method.</em>
	The conceptually clearest procedure is to write the right hand side as a polynomial in standard form (i.e. collect up all <m>x^2</m> terms, all <m>x</m>  terms and all constant terms)
	<md>
	<mrow>
	3x^2+13x+11=(A+B)x^2 + (4A+3B+C)x +(4A+2B+C)
	</mrow>
	</md>
	For these two polynomials to be the same, the coefficient of <m>x^2</m> on the left hand side and the coefficient of <m>x^2</m> on the right hand side must be the same. Similarly the coefficients of <m>x^1</m> and the coefficients of <m>x^0</m> (i.e. the constant terms) must match. This gives us a system of three equations,
	<md>
	<mrow>
	A+B=3\qquad 4A+3B+C=13\qquad 4A+2B+C=11
	</mrow>
	</md>
	in the three unknowns <m>A,B,C</m>. We can solve this system by
	<ul>
	<li>
		using the first equation, namely <m>A+B=3</m>, to determine <m>A</m> in  terms of <m>B</m>: <m>\ \ A=3-B</m>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Substituting this into the remaining equations eliminates the <m>A</m>,  leaving two equations in the two unknown <m>B,C</m>.
		<md>
		<mrow>
		4(3-B)+3B+C=13\qquad 4(3-B)+2B+C=11
		</mrow>
		</md>
		or
		<md>
		<mrow>
		-B+C=1\qquad -2B+C=-1
		</mrow>
		</md>
	</li>
	<li>
		We can now solve the first of these equations, namely <m>-B+C=1</m>, for  <m>B</m> in terms of <m>C</m>, giving <m>B=C-1</m>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Substituting this into the last equation, namely <m>-2B+C=-1</m>, gives <m>-2(C-1)+C=-1</m> which is easily solved to give
	</li>
	<li>
		<m>C=3</m>, and then <m>B=C-1=2</m> and then <m>A=3-B=1</m>.
	</li>
	</ul>
	Hence

<p>
	<em>Step 3 <mdash/> Sneaky Method.</em>
	The second, sneakier, method for finding <m>A</m>, <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> exploits the fact that <m>3x^2 + 13x + 11 = A(x+2)^2 + B(x+1)(x+2) + C(x+1)</m> must be true for all values of <m>x</m>. In particular, it must be true for <m>x=-1</m>. When <m>x=-1</m>, the factor <m>(x+1)</m> multiplying <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> is exactly zero. So <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> disappear from the equation, leaving us with an easy equation to solve for <m>A</m>:
	<md>
	<mrow>
	3x^2+13x+11\Big|_{x=-1} &amp;=\Big[A(x+2)^2+B(x+1)(x+2) +C(x+1)\Big]_{x=-1}

	Since <m>(x+1)</m> is a factor on the right hand side, it must also be a factor on the left hand side.

	(2x+7)(x+1)=(xB+2B+C)(x+1)\quad\Rightarrow\quad (2x+7)=(xB+2B+C)

The method of partial fractions is not just confined to the problem of integrating  rational functions. There are other integrals <mdash/> such as <m>\int\sec x\dee{x}</m> and  <m>\int \sec^3 x\dee{x}</m> <mdash/> that can be transformed (via substitutions) into integrals of  rational functions.

<subsection><title>The form of partial fraction decompositions</title>
<introduction>
<p>
In the examples above we used the partial fractions method to decompose rational  functions into easily integrated pieces. Each of those examples was quite involved and we  had to spend quite a bit of time factoring and doing long division. The key step in each  of the computations was Step<nbsp/>3 <mdash/> in that step we decomposed the rational function <m>\frac{N(x)}{D(x)}</m> (or <m>\frac{R(x)}{D(x)}</m>), for which the degree of the numerator is strictly smaller than the degree of the denominator, into a sum of particularly simple rational functions, like <m>\frac{A}{x-a}</m>. We did not,  however, give a systematic description of those decompositions.
</p>

<p>
In this subsection we fill that gap by describing the general
	<fn>
		Well <mdash/> not the  completely general form, in the sense that we are not allowing the use of complex numbers.  As a result we have to use both linear and quadratic factors in the denominator. If we  could use complex numbers we would be able to restrict ourselves to linear factors.
	</fn>
form  of partial fraction decompositions. The justification of these forms is not part of the  course, but the interested reader is invited to read the next (optional) subsection where  such justification is given. In the following it is assumed that
<ul>
<li>
	<m>N(x)</m> and <m>D(x)</m> are polynomials with the degree of <m>N(x)</m> strictly  smaller than the degree of <m>D(x)</m>.
</li>
<li>
	<m>K</m> is a constant.
</li>
<li>
	<m>a_1</m>, <m>a_2</m>, <m>\cdots</m>, <m>a_j</m> are all different numbers.
</li>
<li>
	<m>m_1</m>, <m>m_2</m>, <m>\cdots</m>, <m>m_j</m>, and  <m>n_1</m>, <m>n_2</m>, <m>\cdots</m>, <m>n_k</m>  are all strictly positive integers.
</li>
<li>
	<m>x^2+b_1x+c_1</m>, <m>x^2+b_2x+c_2</m>,  <m>\ \cdots\ </m>, <m>x^2+b_kx+c_k</m> are  all different.

<subsection><title>Optional <mdash/> Justification of the partial fraction decompositions</title>
<introduction>
<p>
	We will now see the justification for the form of the partial fraction decompositions. We  will only consider the case in which the denominator has only linear factors. The  arguments when there are quadratic factors too are similar
	<fn>
		If we use complex  numbers then every polynomial can be written as a product of linear factors. This is the  fundamental theorem of algebra.
	</fn>.
</p>
</introduction>

<subsubsection><title>Simple linear factor case</title>
<p>
In the most common partial fraction decomposition, we split up
<md>
<mrow>
\frac{N(x)}{(x-a_1)\times\cdots\times (x-a_d)}
</mrow>
</md>
into a sum of the form
<md>
<mrow>
\frac{A_1}{x-a_1}+\cdots+\frac{A_d}{x-a_d}
</mrow>
</md>
We now show that this decomposition can always be achieved, under the  assumptions that the <m>a_i</m>'s are all different and  <m>N(x)</m> is a polynomial  of degree at most <m>d-1</m>. To do so, we shall repeatedly apply  the following Lemma.
</p>

<lemma xml:id="lem_PFa">
<statement><p>
Let <m>N(x)</m> and <m>D(x)</m> be polynomials of degree <m>n</m> and <m>d</m> respectively, with <m>n\le d</m>. Suppose that <m>a</m> is NOT a zero of <m>D(x)</m>. Then there is a polynomial <m>P(x)</m> of degree <m>p \lt d</m> and a number <m>A</m> such that
<md>
<mrow>
\frac{N(x)}{D(x)\,(x-a)} &amp;=\frac{P(x)}{D(x)}+\frac{A}{x-a}
</mrow>
</md>
</p></statement>
</lemma>

<proof>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
	To save writing, let <m>z=x-a</m>. We then write <m>\tilde N(z)=N(z+a)</m> and  <m>\tilde D(z)=D(z+a)</m>, which are again polynomials of degree <m>n</m> and <m>d</m> respectively. We  also know that <m>\tilde D(0)=D(a)\ne 0</m>.
</li>
<li>
	In order to complete the proof we need to find a  polynomial <m>\tilde P(z)</m> of degree <m>p \lt d</m> and a number <m>A</m> such that
	<md>
	<mrow>
	\frac{\tilde N(z)}{\tilde D(z)\,z}
	=\frac{\tilde P(z)}{\tilde D(z)}+\frac{A}{z}
	=\frac{\tilde P(z) z+A\tilde D(z)}{\tilde D(z)\,z}
	</mrow>
	</md>
	or equivalently, such that
	<md>
	<mrow>
	\tilde P(z) z+A\tilde D(z)=\tilde N(z).
	</mrow>
	</md>
</li>
<li>
	Now look at the polynomial on the left hand side. Every term in <m>\tilde P(z) z</m>, has at least one power of <m>z</m>. So the constant term on the left hand side is exactly the constant term in <m>A\tilde D(z)</m>, which is equal to  <m>A\tilde D(0)</m>. The constant term on the right hand side is equal to <m>\tilde N(0)</m>. So the constant terms on the left and right hand sides are the same if we choose <m>A=\frac{\tilde N(0)}{\tilde D(0)}</m>. Recall that <m>\tilde D(0)</m> cannot be zero, so <m>A</m> is well defined.
</li>
<li>
	Now move <m>A\tilde D(z)</m> to the right hand side.
	<md>
	<mrow>
	\tilde P(z) z=\tilde N(z)-A\tilde D(z)
	</mrow>
	</md>
	The constant terms in <m>\tilde N(z)</m> and <m>A\tilde D(z)</m> are the same, so the right hand side contains no constant term and the right hand side is of the form <m>\tilde N_1(z) z</m> for some polynomial <m>\tilde N_1(z)</m>.
</li>
<li>
	Since <m>\tilde N(z)</m> is of degree at most <m>d</m> and <m>A\tilde D(z)</m> is of degree  exactly <m>d</m>, <m>\tilde N_1</m> is a polynomial of degree <m>d-1</m>. It now suffices to choose  <m>\tilde P(z)=\tilde N_1(z)</m>.

</lemma>

<proof>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
	As we did in the proof of the previous lemma, we write <m>z=x-a</m>. Then <m>\tilde  N(z)=N(z+a)</m> and <m>\tilde D(z)=D(z+a)</m> are polynomials of degree <m>n</m> and <m>d</m> respectively, <m>\tilde D(0)=D(a)\ne 0</m>.

<li>
	In order to complete the proof we have to find a polynomial <m>\tilde P(z)</m> of degree <m>p \lt d</m>  and numbers <m>A_1,\ \cdots,\ A_m</m> such that
	<md>
	<mrow>
	\frac{\tilde N(z)}{\tilde D(z)\,z^m}
	&amp;=\frac{\tilde P(z)}{\tilde D(z)}+\frac{A_1}{z}+\frac{A_2}{z^2}+\cdots

	or equivalently, such that

	=\tilde N(z)
	</mrow>
	</md>
</li>
<li>
	Now look at the polynomial on the left hand side. Every single term on the left hand side, except for the very last one, <m>A_m\tilde D(z)</m>, has at least one power of <m>z</m>. So the constant term on the left hand side is exactly the constant term in <m>A_m\tilde D(z)</m>, which is equal to <m>A_m\tilde D(0)</m>. The constant term on the right hand side is equal to <m>\tilde N(0)</m>. So the constant terms on the left and right hand sides are the same if we choose <m>A_m=\frac{\tilde N(0)}{\tilde D(0)}</m>. Recall that  <m>\tilde D(0)\ne 0</m> so <m>A_m</m> is well defined.
</li>

	</mrow>
	</md>
	The constant terms in <m>\tilde N(z)</m> and <m>A_m\tilde D(z)</m> are the same, so the right hand side contains no constant term and the right hand side is of the form <m>\tilde N_1(z) z</m> with <m>\tilde N_1</m> a polynomial of degree at most <m>d+m-2</m>. (Recall that <m>\tilde N</m> is of degree at most <m>d+m-1</m> and <m>\tilde D</m> is of degree at most <m>d</m>.) Divide the whole equation by <m>z</m> to get

	\tilde P(z) z^{m-1}+A_1z^{m-2}\tilde D(z)+A_2z^{m-3}\tilde D(z)+\cdots +A_{m-1}\tilde D(z) =\tilde N_1(z).
	</mrow>
	</md>
</li>
<li>
	Now, we can repeat the previous argument. The constant term on the left hand side, which is exactly equal to <m>A_{m-1}\tilde D(0)</m> matchs the constant term on the right hand side, which is equal to <m>\tilde N_1(0)</m> if we choose  <m>A_{m-1}=\frac{\tilde N_1(0)}{\tilde D(0)}</m>.

Apply Lemma <xref ref="lem_PFb"/> a second time, with  <m>D(x)=(x-a_3)^{n_3}\times\cdots\times (x-a_d)^{n_d}</m>, <m>N(x)=P(x)</m>, <m>m=n_2</m> and  <m>a=a_2</m>. And so on. Eventually, we end up with

<mrow>
\Big[\frac{A_{1,1}}{x-a_1}+\cdots+\frac{A_{1,n_1}}{(x-a_1)^{n_1}}\Big]+\cdots+
\Big[\frac{A_{d,1}}{x-a_d}+\cdots+\frac{A_{d,n_d}}{(x-a_d)^{n_d}}\Big]

which is exactly what we were trying to show.
